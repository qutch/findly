Even if people get access to hashed passwords, they would need to know how to unhash them.\n\t- Use one-way cryptographic functions: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc..\n\n#### Dictionary Attacks\n- Hashing all of the most common passwords or words and check between the hashed passwords text file and the list of all possible hashes that the attacker created\n\n#### Hardening Password Hashes\n- Add random \"salt\" to each password before hashing\n\t- hash(password + salt) -> password hash\n\t- Where each user has their own unique salt. These can be stored in plain text\n- Choosing hashes that would be purposely slow to decrypt is common\n\n#### Password Reset or Recovery\n- Knowledge Based Authentication (KBA)\n\t- Questions and answers that only you would know\n\t- Could be found by anyone or socially engineered out of people\n\t- Not recommended by experts\n- Account Based\n\t- Tied to email or phone linked to account\n",

The padding adds randomness to RSA which is deterministic.\n### Encryption and Decryption\n- Symmetric\n\t- Both Encryption and Decryption require a key\n- Asymmetric\n\t- There are two keys, a public (known or available) key, and a private (hidden and not available) key\n\t- The public key, usually used to encrypt, cannot decrypt, only private keys can decrypt\n\t- A message encrypted with one key must be decrypted by the other key\n\t- This makes the public key safe to share over the internet and share publicly without danger\n\t- Keys are actually secure by very hard math problems with prime numbers. Very computationally expensive, not possible to find someone's private key.

Now the message is sent and intercepted by the person in the middle and now can be changed or decrypted.\n\t- Then the person in the middle encrypts the message after doing whatever and sends it to the other endpoint with some delay and without any trace.\n- Only way to authenticate a public key is through trust\n\t- Web of trust --> Social network of people who sign each others keys\n\t- Certificate authorities --> Companies that verify people and sign keys for a price (X.509 certificate)\n- Web of Trust\n\t- Every time a person wants to authenticate a key, they must ask others who already have that key and they compare it\n- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\n\t- If someone wants to verify a key, they can check a list of trusted keys from a company (some automatically come with browser or OS)\n\n- SSL/TLS\n\t- Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n\t\t- Supersedes SSL, more secure and used today\n\t\t- Certificates given to websites or servers that are signed by a trusted company.

Could act as someone else to trick people.\n- Expiration\n\t- There is always some sort of expiration on keys and/or certificates. This makes information safe and secure outside of the active time for certificates.\n\t- Shorter lifetime = better. However, realistically it is very inconvenient and not feasible.\n\t\t- Problem right now is that many certificates have multi-year lifespans.\n- Revocation\n\t- Used to mitigate key compromises.\n\t- Revocations allow key owners to bee able to revoke/disable the certificate marking it as unsafe\n\t- CRLs (Certificate Revocation List) - List of stolen certificates, checks against this list are run to ensure security\n\t\t- Can be slow to search CRL's\n\t\t- CRL's can be ddossed to ensure that no one can check a CRL\n\t\t- Not typically used today\n- OSCP\n",

Would you\nstill be in there? Further imagine that your still-living brain has been transplanted into the\nbody of a person whose own brain was severely damaged. To whose home should the recov-\nered patient return?\nIf you answered that the patient should return to your home, you illustrated what most of\nus believe—that we reside in our head. An acquaintance of mine received a new heart do-\nnated by a woman who in turn had received a matching heart-lung transplant. When the two\nchanced to meet in their hospital ward, the donor introduced herself: “I think you have my\nheart.” But only her heart; her self, she assumed, still resided in her skull.\nIn the next two modules, we explore the biology of the mind—the links between our brain\nand our behavior. No principle is more central to today’s psychology, or to this book, than\nthis: Everything psychological—every idea, every mood, every urge—is simultaneously biological.\nWe may talk separately of biological and psychological influences, but to think, feel, or act\nwithout a body would be like running without legs.\nIn exploring the links between our biology and our behavior, we will start small and build\nfrom the bottom up. In Module 3, we take a close look at the nervous and endocrine systems.\nIn Module 4, we focus on brain structures and their functions.\n“You’re certainly a lot less fun since the operation.\n© The New Yorker Collection, 1992, Gahan Wilson, from\ncartoonbank.com.

By studying the links between biological activity and psy-\nchological events, biological psychologists are gaining a better understanding of\nsuch events.\nNeural Communication\nThe human body is complexity built from simplicity. Part of this complexity is our\namazing internal communication system, which makes the Internet look simple.\nAcross the world, researchers are unlocking the mysteries of how our brain uses\nelectrical and chemical processes to take in, organize, interpret, store, and  use infor-\nmation. The story begins with the system’s basic building block, the neuron, or\nnerve cell. We’ll look first at its structure, and then at how neurons work together.\nNeurons\n3-1: What are neurons, and how do they transmit information?\nNeurons differ, but all are variations on the same theme. Each consists of a cell body\nand its branching fibers. The bushy dendrite fibers receive information and con-\nduct it toward the cell body. From there, the cell’s axon (sometimes covered with a\nmyelin sheath) passes the message along to other neurons or to muscles or glands.\nAxons speak. Dendrites listen.\nUnlike the short dendrites, axons can be very long, projecting several feet\nthrough the body. A neuron carrying orders to a leg muscle, for example, has a cell\nbody and axon roughly on the scale of a basketball attached to a rope 4 miles long. \nNeurons transmit messages when stimulated by signals from our senses or when\ntriggered by chemical signals from neighboring neurons. At such times, a neuron\nfires an impulse, called the action potential—a brief electrical charge that travels\ndown its axon (FIGURE 3.1).\nDepending on the type of fiber, a neural impulse travels at speeds ranging from a\nsluggish 2 miles per hour to a breakneck 200 or more miles per hour. But even this\ntop speed is 3 million times slower than that of electricity through a wire. We meas-\nure brain activity in milliseconds (thousandths of a second) and computer activity\n\nMODULE\n3\nbiological psychology  the scientific study\nof the links between biological (genetic,\nneural, hormonal) and psychological\nprocesses.

Thus, unlike the nearly instantaneous reac-\ntions of a high - speed computer, your reaction to a sudden event, such as a child\ndarting in front of your car, may take a quarter - second or more. Your brain is vastly\nmore complex than a computer, but slower at executing simple responses.\nEach neuron is a miniature decision - making device performing complex calcula-\ntions as it receives signals from hundreds, even thousands, of other neurons. Most\nof these signals are excitatory, somewhat like pushing a neuron’s accelerator. Others\nare inhibitory, more like pushing its brake. If excitatory signals minus inhibitory sig-\nnals exceed a minimum level of stimulation, or threshold, the combined signals\ntrigger an action potential. (Think of it this way: If the excitatory party animals out-\nvote the inhibitory party poopers, the party’s on.) The action potential then travels\ndown the axon, which branches into junctions with hundreds or thousands of other\nneurons and with the body’s muscles and glands.\nIncreasing the level of stimulation above the threshold will not increase the neu-\nral impulse’s intensity. The neuron’s reaction is an all - or - none response: Like guns,\nneurons either fire or they don’t. How, then, do we detect the intensity of a stimu-\nlus? How do we distinguish a gentle touch from a big hug? A strong stimulus—a\nslap rather than a tap—can trigger more neurons to fire, and to fire more often. But\nit does not affect the action potential’s strength or speed. Squeezing a trigger harder\nwon’t make a bullet go  faster.\nHow Neurons Communicate\n3-2: How do nerve cells communicate with other nerve cells?\nNeurons interweave so intricately that even with a microscope you would have trou-\nble seeing where one neuron ends and another begins. Scientists once believed that\nthe axon of one cell fused with the dendrites of another in an uninterrupted fabric.\nThen British physiologist Sir Charles Sherrington (1857–1952) noticed that neural\nimpulses were taking an unexpectedly long time to travel a neural pathway. Infer-\nring that there must be a brief interruption in the transmission, Sherrington called\nthe meeting point between neurons a synapse.\nWe now know that the axon terminal of one neuron is in fact separated from the\nreceiving neuron by a synaptic gap (or synaptic cleft) less than a millionth of an inch\nwide. Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852–1934) marveled at these\nnear - unions of neurons, calling them “protoplasmic kisses.” “Like elegant ladies air -\n kissing so as not to muss their makeup, dendrites and axons don’t quite touch,”\nnotes poet Diane Ackerman (2004). How do the neurons execute this protoplasmic\nkiss, sending information across the tiny synaptic gap? The answer is one of the im-\nportant scientific discoveries of  our age.\nWhen an action potential reaches the knoblike terminals at an axon’s end, it trig-\ngers the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters (FIGURE 3.2).\nWithin 1/10,000th of a second, the neurotransmitter molecules cross the synaptic\ngap and bind to receptor sites on the receiving neuron—as precisely as a key fits a\nlock. For an instant, the neurotransmitter unlocks tiny channels at the receiving\nsite, and electrically charged atoms flow in, exciting or inhibiting the receiving\n neuron’s readiness to fire. Then, in a process called reuptake, the sending neuron re-\nabsorbs the excess neurotransmitters. \nHow Neurotransmitters Influence Us\n3-3: How do neurotransmitters influence behavior?\nIn their quest to understand neural communication, researchers have discovered\ndozens of different neurotransmitters and raised new questions: Are certain neuro-\ntransmitters found only in specific places? How do they affect our moods, memo-\nries, and mental abilities? Can we boost or diminish these effects through drugs or\ndiet?\n“What one neuron tells another neuron\nis simply how much it is excited.”\n—Francis Crick, The Astonishing Hypothesis,\n1994\n“All information processing in the\nbrain involves neurons ‘talking to’ each\nother at synapses.”\n—Neuroscientist Solomon H. Snyder (1984)\nMyEx8eMod_03_MyersEx8eModules  3/10/10  11:20 AM  Page 38\nOther modules explore neurotransmitter influences on hunger and thinking, de-\npression and euphoria, addictions and therapy. For now, let’s glimpse how neuro-\ntransmitters influence our motions and our emotions. A particular pathway in the\nbrain may use only one or two neurotransmitters (FIGURE 3.3), and particular neuro-\ntransmitters may have particular effects on behavior and emotions (TABLE 3.1 on the\nnext page offers examples). Acetylcholine (ACh) is one of the best - understood neu-\nrotransmitters. In addition to its role in learning and memory, ACh is the messenger\nat every junction between a motor neuron (which carries information from the\nbrain and spinal cord to the body’s tissues) and skeletal muscles. When ACh is re-\nleased to our muscle cell receptors, the muscle contracts. If ACh transmission is\nNEURAL AND HORMONAL SYSTEMS\n|\nMODULE 3\n| 39\nReceiving neuron\nSending neuron\n1.

The morphine, an opiate drug that ele-\nvates mood and eases pain, bound to receptors in areas linked with mood and pain\nsensations. But why would the brain have these “opiate receptors”? Why would it\nhave a chemical lock, unless it also had a natural key to open it?\nResearchers soon confirmed that the brain does indeed produce its own natu-\nrally occurring opiates. Our body releases several types of neurotransmitter mole-\ncules similar to morphine in response to pain and vigorous exercise. These\nendorphins (short for endogenous [produced within] morphine), as we now call\nthem, help explain good feelings such as the “runner’s high,” the painkilling effects\nof acupuncture, and the indifference to pain in some severely injured people. \nDrugs and other chemicals affect brain chemistry at synapses, often by either ex-\nciting or inhibiting neurons’ firing. Agonist molecules may be similar enough to a\nneurotransmitter to bind to its receptor and mimic its effects. Some opiate drugs\nare agonists and produce a temporary “high” by amplifying normal sensations of\narousal or pleasure. Antagonists also bind to receptors but their effect is instead to\nblock a neurotransmitter’s functioning. They may occupy sites on the receiving neu-\nron and block the neurotransmitter’s effects. Curare, a poison some South Ameri-\ncan Indians have applied to hunting-dart tips, occupies and blocks ACh receptor\nsites on muscles, producing paralysis in animals struck by the dart.\nThe Nervous System\n3-4: What are the functional divisions of the nervous system?\nTo live is to take in information from the world and the body’s tissues, to make de-\ncisions, and to send back information and orders to the body’s tissues. All this hap-\npens thanks to our body’s nervous system. The brain and spinal cord form the\ncentral nervous system (CNS), the body’s decision maker. The peripheral\nnervous system (PNS) is responsible for gathering information and for transmit-\nting CNS decisions to other body parts. Nerves, electrical cables formed of bun-\ndles of axons, link the CNS with the body’s sensory receptors, muscles, and glands.\nPhysician Lewis Thomas, on the\nendorphins: “There it is, a biologically\nuniversal act of mercy. I cannot explain\nit, except to say that I would have put\nit in had I been around at the very\nbeginning, sitting as a member of a\nplanning committee.”\n—The Youngest Science, 1983\nMyEx8eMod_03_MyersEx8eModules  3/10/10  11:20 AM  Page 40\nThe optic nerve, for example, bundles a million axons into a single cable carrying\nthe messages each eye sends to the brain (Mason & Kandel, 1991).\nInformation travels in the nervous system through three types of neurons.\nSensory neurons carry messages from the body’s tissues and sensory receptors\ninward to the brain and spinal cord, for processing. The central nervous system\nthen sends instructions out to the body’s tissues via the motor neurons. In be-\ntween the sensory input and motor output, interneurons process information\nwithin the CNS. Our complexity resides mostly in our interneuron systems. Our\nnervous system has a few million sensory neurons, a few million motor neurons,\nand billions and billions of interneurons.\nThe Peripheral Nervous System\nOur peripheral nervous system has two components—somatic and autonomic. Our\nsomatic nervous system enables voluntary control of our skeletal muscles. As you\nreach the bottom of this page, your somatic nervous system will report to your brain\nthe current state of your skeletal muscles and carry instructions back, triggering\nyour hand to turn  the page.\nOur autonomic nervous system controls our glands and the muscles of our\ninternal organs, influencing such functions as glandular activity, heartbeat, and\ndigestion. Like an automatic pilot, this system may be consciously overridden,\nbut usually it operates on its own (autonomously).

If something alarms, enrages, or challenges you, your sympathetic system\nwill accelerate your heartbeat, raise your blood pressure, slow your digestion,\nraise your blood sugar, and cool you with perspiration, making you alert and\nready for action. When the stress subsides, your parasympathetic nervous sys-\ntem produces opposite effects. It conserves energy as it calms you by decreasing\nyour heartbeat, lowering your blood sugar, and so forth. In everyday situations,\nthe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems work together to keep you\nin a steady internal state.\nMyEx8eMod_03_MyersEx8eModules  3/10/10  11:20 AM  Page 41\n42\n|\nMODULE 3\n|\nNEURAL AND HORMONAL SYSTEMS\nThe Central Nervous System\nFrom the simplicity of neurons “talking” to other neurons arises the complexity of\nthe central nervous system’s brain and spinal cord.\nIt is the brain that enables our humanity—our thinking, feeling, and acting. Tens\nof billions of neurons, each communicating with thousands of other neurons, yield\nan ever - changing wiring diagram that dwarfs a powerful computer. With some 40\nbillion neurons, each having roughly 10,000 contacts with other neurons, we end\nup with perhaps 400 trillion synapses—places where neurons meet and greet their\nneighbors (de Courten - Myers, 2005). A grain - of - sand–sized speck of your brain\ncontains some 100,000 neurons and one billion “talking” synapses (Ramachandran\n& Blakeslee, 1998).\nThe brain’s neurons cluster into work groups called neural networks. To under-\nstand why, Stephen Kosslyn and Olivier Koenig (1992, p. 12) have invited us to\n“think about why cities exist; why don’t people distribute themselves more evenly\nacross the countryside?” Like people networking with people, neurons network with\nnearby neurons with which they can have short, fast connections. \nThe spinal cord is an information highway connecting the peripheral nervous system\nto the brain. Ascending neural fibers send up sensory information, and descending\nfibers send back motor - control information. The neural pathways governing our \nreflexes, our automatic responses to stimuli, illustrate the spinal cord’s work.

These often communicate through an interneuron. The knee - jerk response, for ex-\nample, involves one such simple pathway. A headless warm body could do it.\nAnother such pathway enables the pain reflex illustrated in FIGURE 3.6.When your\nfinger touches a flame, neural activity excited by the heat travels via sensory neu-\nrons to  interneurons in your spinal cord. These interneurons respond by activating\nmotor neurons leading to the muscles in your arm. Because the simple pain reflex\npathway runs through the spinal cord and right back out, your hand jerks from the\ncandle’s flame before your brain receives and responds to the information that\ncauses you to feel pain.

Were the top of\nyour spinal cord severed, you would not feel pain from your body below. Nor would\nyou feel pleasure. With your brain literally out of touch with your body, you would lose\nall sensation and voluntary movement in body regions with sensory and motor con-\nnections to the spinal cord below its point of injury. You would exhibit the knee - jerk\nwithout feeling the tap. When the brain center keeping the brakes on erections is sev-\nered, men paralyzed below the waist may be capable of an erection (a simple reflex) if\ntheir genitals are stimulated (Goldstein, 2000). Women similarly paralyzed may re-\nspond with vaginal lubrication. But, depending on where and how completely the\nspinal cord is severed, they may be genitally unresponsive to erotic images and have\nno genital feeling (Kennedy & Over, 1990; Sipski & Alexander, 1999). To produce\nbodily pain or pleasure, the sensory information must reach the brain.\nThe Endocrine System\n3-5: How does the endocrine system—the body’s slower information system—\ntransmit its messages?\nSo far we have focused on the body’s speedy electrochemical information system.\nInterconnected with the nervous system is a second communication system, the\nendocrine system. The endocrine system’s glands secrete another form of chemi-\ncal messengers, hormones, which travel through the bloodstream and affect other\ntissues, including the brain. When they act on the brain, they influence our interest\nMyEx8eMod_03_MyersEx8eModules  3/10/10  11:20 AM  Page 43\n44\n|\nMODULE 3\n|\nNEURAL AND HORMONAL SYSTEMS\nadrenal [ah - DREEN-el] glands a pair of\nendocrine glands that sit just above the\nkidneys and secrete hormones (epinephrine\nand norepinephrine) that help arouse the\nbody in times of stress.\npituitary gland the endocrine system’s\nmost influential gland.

FIGURE 3.7 illustrates the locations and functions of\nglands in the endocrine system.\nSome hormones are chemically identical to neurotransmitters (those chemical\nmessengers that diffuse across a synapse and excite or inhibit an adjacent neuron).\nThe endocrine system and nervous system are therefore close relatives: Both pro-\nduce molecules that act on receptors elsewhere. Like many relatives, they also dif-\nfer. The speedy nervous system zips messages from eyes to brain to hand in a\nfraction of a second. Endocrine messages trudge along in the bloodstream, taking\nseveral seconds or more to travel from the gland to the target tissue. If the nervous\nsystem’s communication delivers messages rather like e - mail, the endocrine system\nis the body’s snail mail. But slow and steady sometimes wins the race. Endocrine\nmessages tend to outlast the effects of neural messages. That helps explain why\nupset feelings may linger, sometimes beyond our thinking about what upset us. In a\nmoment of danger, for example, the autonomic nervous system orders the adrenal\nglands on top of the kidneys to release epinephrine and norepinephrine (also called\nadrenaline and noradrenaline). These hormones increase heart rate, blood pressure,\nand blood sugar, providing us with a surge of energy. When the emergency passes,\nthe hormones—and the feelings of excitement—linger  a while. The endocrine sys-\ntem’s hormones influence many aspects of our lives—growth, reproduction, metab-\nolism, mood—and work with our nervous system to keep everything in balance\nwhile we respond to stress, exertion, and our own thoughts.\nThe most influential endocrine gland is the pituitary gland, a pea - sized struc-\nture located in the core of the brain, where it is controlled by an adjacent brain area,\nthe hypothalamus. The pituitary releases hormones that influence growth. Its secre-\ntions also influence the release of hormones by other endocrine glands. The pitu-\nitary, then, is a sort of master gland (whose own master is the hypothalamus). For\nexample, under the brain’s influence, the pituitary triggers your sex glands to re-\nlease sex hormones. These in turn influence your brain and  behavior.\nThis feedback system (brain pituitary other glands hormones brain)\nreveals the intimate connection of the nervous and endocrine systems. The nervous\nsystem directs endocrine secretions, which then affect the nervous system. Con-\nducting and coordinating this whole electrochemical orchestra is that maestro we\ncall the brain.\nHypothalamus\n(brain region controlling\nthe pituitary gland)\nThyroid gland\n(affects metabolism,\namong other things)\nPituitary gland\n(secretes many different \nhormones, some of which \naffect other glands)\nParathyroids\n(help regulate the level\nof calcium in the blood)\nAdrenal glands\n(inner part helps \ntrigger the\n“fight-or-flight” \nresponse)\nPancreas\n(regulates the level of \nsugar in the blood)\nOvary\n(secretes female\nsex hormones)\nTestis\n(secretes male sex\nhormones)\nFIGURE 3.7 The endocrine system\nMyEx8eMod_03_MyersEx8eModules  3/10/10  11:20 AM  Page 44\n45\nREVIEWING\n\n3-1: What are neurons, and how do they transmit information?\nNeurons are the elementary components of the nervous system, the\nbody’s speedy electrochemical information system. A neuron sends\nsignals through its axons, and receives signals through its branching\ndendrites. If the combined signals are strong enough, the neuron\nfires, transmitting an electrical impulse (the action potential) down\nits axon by means of a chemistry-to-electricity process. The neu-\nron’s reaction is an all-or-none process.\n3-2: How do nerve cells communicate with other nerve cells?\nWhen action potentials reach the end of an axon (the axon termi-\nnals), they stimulate the release of neurotransmitters. These chemical\nmessengers carry a message from the sending neuron across a\nsynapse to receptor sites on a receiving neuron. The sending neu-\nron, in a process called reuptake, then normally reabsorbs the\nexcess neurotransmitter molecules in the synaptic gap. The receiv-\ning neuron, if the signals from that neuron and others are strong\nenough, generates its own action potential and relays the message\nto other cells.\n3-3: How do neurotransmitters influence behavior? Each neu-\nrotransmitter travels a designated path in the brain and has a par-\nticular effect on behavior and emotions. Acetylcholine affects mus-\ncle action, learning, and memory. Endorphins are natural opiates\nreleased in response to pain and exercise. \nModule Review\n1.

The somatic nervous system enables\nvoluntary control of the skeletal muscles. The autonomic nervous sys-\ntem, through its sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, controls\ninvoluntary muscles and glands. Neurons are the basic building\nblocks of the nervous system. Sensory neurons carry incoming infor-\nmation from sense receptors to the brain and spinal cord, and motor\nneurons carry information from the brain and spinal cord out to the\nmuscles and glands. Interneurons communicate within the brain and\nspinal cord and between sensory and motor neurons. Neurons clus-\nter into working neural networks.\n3-5: How does the endocrine system—the body’s slower infor-\nmation system—transmit its messages? The endocrine system is a\nset of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream, where they\ntravel through the body and affect other tissues, including the\nbrain. In an intricate feedback system, the brain’s hypothalamus\ninfluences the pituitary gland (the endocrine system’s master gland)\nwhich influences other glands (such as the adrenals) to release hor-\nmones, which in turn influence the brain.\nRehearse It!\nAnswers: 1. b, 2. c, 3. a, 4. d, 5. b, 6. c, 7. a, 8. b,\n9. a, 10. a.\nNeural and Hormonal Systems\nMyEx8eMod_03_MyersEx8eModules  3/10/10  11:20 AM  Page 45\n46\n|\nMODULE 3\n|\nNEURAL AND HORMONAL SYSTEMS\nnervous system, p. 40\ncentral nervous system (CNS), p. 40\nperipheral nervous system (PNS), \np. 40\nnerves, p. 40\nsensory neurons, p. 41\nmotor neurons, p. 41\ninterneurons, p. 41\nsomatic nervous system, p. 41\nautonomic [aw - tuh - NAHM-ik] nervous\nsystem, p. 41\nsympathetic nervous system, p. 41\nparasympathetic nervous system, p. 41\nreflex, p. 42\nendocrine [EN-duh - krin] system, p. 43\nhormones, p. 43\nadrenal [ah - DREEN-el] glands, p. 44\npituitary gland, p. 44\nTerms and Concepts to Remember\nTest For Success: Critical Thinking Exercise\nBy Amy Himsel, El Camino College\n1.

    "content": "The Biomedical Therapies\nOne way to treat psychological disorders is with psychotherapy, in which a trained\ntherapist uses psychological techniques to assist someone seeking to overcome diffi-\nculties or achieve personal growth. The other, often used with serious disorders, is\nbiomedical therapy—physically changing the brain’s functioning by altering its\nchemistry with drugs, or affecting its circuitry with various kinds of direct stimula-\ntion or psychosurgery. Psychologists can provide psychological therapies. But with a\nfew exceptions, only psychiatrists (as medical doctors) offer biomedical therapies.\nDrug Therapies\n36-1: What are the drug therapies? What criticisms have been leveled against\ndrug therapies?\nBy far the most widely used biomedical treatments today are the drug therapies. Since\nthe 1950s, discoveries in psychopharmacology (the study of drug effects on mind\nand behavior) have revolutionized the treatment of people with severe disorders, liber-\nating hundreds of thousands from hospital confinement. Thanks to drug therapy—and\nto efforts to minimize involuntary hospitalization and to support people with commu-\nnity mental health programs—the resident population of U.S. state and county mental\nhospitals is a small fraction of what it was a half - century ago (FIGURE 36.1).\nDrug Therapies\nBrain Stimulation\nPsychosurgery\nTherapeutic Life-Style Change\nMODULE\n\n36\nMODULE\n534\n700 \n600 \n500 \n400 \n300 \n200 \n100 \n0 \n1900 \nYear  \n1910 \n1980 \n1920 \n1930 \n1940 \n1970 \n1990 \n2000 \n1960 \n1950 \nIntroduction of antipsychotic drugs \nRapid decline in \nthe state and county \nmental hospital \npopulation \nU.S. state  \nand county  \nmental hospital \nresidents, in \nthousands \nFIGURE 36.1 The emptying of U.S.\nmental hospitals After the widespread\nintroduction of antipsychotic drugs, starting\nin about 1955, the number of residents in\nstate and county mental hospitals declined\nsharply. But in the rush to deinstitutionalize\nthe mentally ill, many people who were ill -\nequipped to care for themselves were left\nhomeless on city streets. (Data from the U.S.\nNational Institute of Mental Health and\nBureau of the Census, 2004.)\nAlmost any new treatment, including drug therapy, is greeted by an initial wave of\nenthusiasm as many people apparently improve. But that enthusiasm often diminishes\nafter researchers subtract the rates of (1) spontaneous recovery (normal recovery among\nuntreated persons) and (2) recovery due to\nthe placebo effect, which arises from the posi-\ntive expectations of patients and mental\nhealth workers alike. So, to evaluate the ef-\nfectiveness of any new drug, researchers\ngive half the patients the drug, and the\nother half a similar - appearing placebo. Be-\ncause neither the staff nor the patients know\nwho gets which, this is called a double - blind\nprocedure. The good news: In double - blind\nstudies, several types of drugs have proven\nuseful in treating psychological disorders.\nDrug or placebo effect?\nFor many people, depression\nlifts while taking an antide-\npressant drug. But people\ngiven a placebo may experi-\nence the same effect. Double-\nblind clinical trials suggest\nthat, especially for those\nwith severe depression, anti-\ndepressant drugs do have at\nleast a modest clinical effect.\nLes Snider/The Image Works\n© The New Yorker Collection, 2007, Edward Koren from\ncartoonbank.com.

These antipsychotic drugs, such as chlor-\npromazine (sold as Thorazine), dampened responsiveness to irrelevant stimuli.\nThus, they provided the most help to patients experiencing positive symptoms of\nschizophrenia, such as auditory hallucinations and paranoia (Lehman et al.,\n1998; Lenzenweger et al., 1989).\nThe molecules of most conventional antipsychotic drugs are similar enough to\nmolecules of the neurotransmitter dopamine to occupy its receptor sites and block\nits activity. This finding reinforces the idea that an overactive dopamine system con-\ntributes to schizophrenia. Antipsychotics are powerful drugs. Some can produce\nsluggishness, tremors, and twitches similar to those of Parkinson’s disease, which is\nmarked by too little dopamine (Kaplan & Saddock, 1989). Long-term use of these\nmedications can also produce tardive dyskinesia with involuntary movements of the\nfacial muscles (such as grimacing), tongue, and limbs. \nPatients exhibiting the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy and\nwithdrawal, often do not respond well to conventional antipsychotic drugs. Newer\natypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine (marketed since 1989 as Clozaril), target\nboth dopamine and serotonin receptors. This helps alleviate negative symptoms,\nsometimes enabling “awakenings” in these individuals. Atypical antipsychotics may\nalso help those who have positive symptoms but have not responded to other drugs.\nAlthough not more effective in controlling schizophrenia symptoms, many of the\nnewer antipsychotics have fewer conventional side effects. But they may increase\nthe risk of obesity and diabetes (Lieberman et al., 2005, 2006). One drug now un-\ndergoing testing stimulates receptors for the amino acid called glutamate. An initial\ntrial has raised hopes that it may reduce schizophrenia symptoms with fewer side ef-\nfects (Berenson, 2007). \nDespite their drawbacks, antipsychotic drugs, combined with life-skills programs\nand family support, have enabled hundreds of thousands of people with schizophre-\nnia who had been consigned to the back wards of mental hospitals to return to work\nand to near-normal lives (Leucht et al., 2003).\nAntianxiety Drugs\nLike alcohol, antianxiety agents, such as Xanax or Ativan, depress central nervous\nsystem activity (and so should not be used in combination with alcohol). Antianxi-\nety drugs are often used in combination with psychological therapy. A new antianx-\niety drug, the antibiotic D-cycloserine, acts upon a receptor that facilitates the\nextinction of learned fears. Experiments indicate that the drug enhances the bene-\nfits of exposure therapy and helps relieve the symptoms of post-traumatic stress dis-\norder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Davis, 2005; Kushner et al., 2007). \nA criticism sometimes made of the behavior therapies—that they reduce symp-\ntoms without resolving underlying problems—is also made of antianxiety drugs.\nUnlike the behavior therapies, however, these substances may be used as an ongo-\ning treatment. “Popping a Xanax” at the first sign of tension can produce psycho-\nlogical dependence; the immediate relief reinforces a person’s tendency to take\ndrugs when anxious. Antianxiety drugs can also cause physiological dependence.\nAfter heavy use, people who stop taking them may experience increased anxiety, in-\nsomnia, and other withdrawal symptoms.\nOver the dozen years at the end of the twentieth century, the rate of outpatient\ntreatment for anxiety disorders nearly doubled. The proportion of psychiatric pa-\ntients receiving medication during that time increased from 52 to 70 percent (Olf-\nson et al., 2004). And the new standard drug treatment for anxiety disorders?\nAntidepressants.\nTHE BIOMEDICAL THERAPIES\n|\nMODULE 36\n| 535\nbiomedical therapy prescribed medica-\ntions or medical procedures that act directly\non the patient’s nervous system.\npsychopharmacology the study of the\neffects of drugs on mind and behavior.\nantipsychotic drugs drugs used to treat\nschizophrenia and other forms of severe\nthought disorder.\nantianxiety drugs drugs used to control\nanxiety and agitation.\nOn U.S. college campuses, the 9 percent of\ncounseling center visitors taking psychiatric\nmedication in 1994 nearly tripled, to 24.5\npercent in 2004 (Duenwald, 2004).\nPerhaps you can guess an occasional side\neffect of L-dopa, a drug that raises\ndopamine levels for Parkinson’s patients:\nhallucinations.\nMyEx8eMod_36_MyersEx8e Modules  5/7/10  10:50 AM  Page 535\n536\n|\nMODULE 36\n|\nTHE BIOMEDICAL THERAPIES\nSynaptic gap\nReceptors\nReceiving neuron\nNeurotransmitter\nmolecule\nAction\npotential\nSending\nneuron\nReuptake\nProzac\nProzac partially blocks normal reuptake of the\nneurotransmitter serotonin; excess serotonin\nin synapse enhances its mood-lifting effect.\nMessage is received; excess neurotransmitter\nmolecules are reabsorbed by sending neuron.\nMessage is sent across synaptic gap.\n(c)\n(b)\n(a)\nSerotonin\nFIGURE 36.2 Biology of antidepressants\nShown here is the action of Prozac, which \npartially blocks the reuptake of serotonin.\nantidepressant drugs drugs used to treat\ndepression; also increasingly prescribed for\nanxiety. Different types work by altering the\navailability of various neurotransmitters.\nAntidepressant Drugs\nThe antidepressants were named for their ability to lift people up from a state of\ndepression, and this was their main use until recently. The label is a bit of a mis-\nnomer now that these drugs are increasingly being used to successfully treat anxiety\ndisorders such as obsessive - compulsive disorder. They work by increasing the avail-\nability of norepinephrine or serotonin, neurotransmitters that elevate arousal and\nmood and appear scarce during depression. Fluoxetine, which tens of millions of\nusers worldwide have known as Prozac, partially blocks the reabsorption and re-\nmoval of serotonin from synapses (FIGURE 36.2). Because they slow the synaptic vac-\nuuming up of serotonin, Prozac and its cousins Zoloft and Paxil are called\nselective - serotonin - reuptake - inhibitors (SSRIs). Other antidepressants work by block-\ning the reabsorption or breakdown of both norepinephrine and serotonin. Though\neffective, these dual - action drugs have more potential side effects, such as dry\nmouth, weight gain, hypertension, or dizzy spells (Anderson, 2000; Mulrow, 1999).\nAdministering them by means of a patch, bypassing the intestines and liver, helps\nreduce such side effects (Bodkin & Amsterdam, 2002).\nAfter the introduction of SSRI drugs, the percentage of patients receiving med-\nication for depression jumped dramatically, from 70 percent in 1987, the year be-\nfore SSRIs were introduced, to 89 percent in 2001 (Olfson et al., 2003; Stafford et\nal., 2001). In the United States, 11 percent of women and 5 percent of men are now\ntaking antidepressants (Barber, 2008).\nBe advised: Patients with depression who begin taking antidepressants do not\nwake up the next day singing “Oh, what a beautiful morning!” Although the drugs\nbegin to influence neurotransmission within hours, their full psychological effect\noften requires four weeks (and may involve a side effect of diminished sexual de-\nsire). One possible reason for the delay is that increased serotonin promotes neuro-\ngenesis—the birth of new brain cells, perhaps reversing stress - induced loss of\nneurons (Becker & Wojtowicz, 2007; Jacobs, 2004).\nAntidepressant drugs are not the only way to give the body a lift. Aerobic exer-\ncise, which helps calm people who feel anxious and energize those who feel de-\npressed, does about as much good for some people with mild to moderate\ndepression, and has additional positive side effects (more on this topic later in this\nmodule). Cognitive therapy, by helping people reverse their habitual negative think-\ning style, can boost the drug - aided relief from depression and reduce the post -\n treatment risk of relapse (Hollon et al., 2002; Keller et al., 2000; Vittengl et al.,\nMyEx8eMod_36_MyersEx8e Modules  5/7/10  10:50 AM  Page 536\n2007). Better yet, some studies suggest, is to attack\ndepression from both above and below (Goldapple\net al., 2004; TADS, 2004). Use antidepressant drugs\n(which work, bottom - up, on the emotion - forming\nlimbic system) in conjunction with cognitive-\nbehavioral therapy (which works, top - down, starting\nwith changed frontal lobe activity).\nEveryone agrees that people with depression\noften improve after a month on antidepressants. But\ndrug effects, like psychotherapy effects, can be in-\nflated by other influences. After allowing for natural\nrecovery and the placebo effect, how big is the drug\neffect? Not big, report Irving Kirsch and his col-\nleagues (1998, 2002). Their analyses of double -\n blind clinical trials indicate that placebos accounted for about 75 percent of the\nactive drug’s effect. In a follow-up review that included unpublished clinical trials,\nthe antidepressant drug effect was again modest (Kirsch et al., 2008). The placebo\neffect was less for those with severe depression, who benefited somewhat more from\ntaking the drug. “Given these results, there seems little reason to prescribe antide-\npressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients, unless alterna-\ntive treatments have failed,” Kirsch concluded (BBC, 2008). For about 1 in 4\npeople who do not respond to a particular antidepressant, switching to another\ndoes bring relief (Rush et al., 2006). Scientists dream of a not-too-far-off day when\npatients may be screened for genetic variations that will indicate drugs to use or\navoid. \nThe effects of drug therapy may be less exciting than many TV ads suggest, but\nthey also are less frightening than other stories have warned. Some people taking\nProzac, for example, have committed suicide, but their numbers seem fewer than\nwe would expect from the millions of depressed people now taking that medication.\nMoreover, a large British study revealed that the ups and downs of adolescent SSRI\nprescriptions over time were unrelated to the adolescent suicide rate (Wheeler et\nal., 2008). Prozac users who commit suicide are like cell-phone users who get brain\ncancer. Given the millions of people taking Prozac and using cell phones, alarming\nanecdotes tell us nothing. \nThe question critical thinkers want answered is this: Do these groups suffer an\nelevated rate of suicide and brain cancer? The answer in each case appears to be no\n(Grunebaum et al., 2004; Paulos, 1995; Tollefson et al., 1993, 1994). Three recent\nstudies of between 70,000 and 439,000 patients concur that, in the long run, pa-\ntients attempt fewer suicides if treated with antidepressants (Gibbons et al., 2007;\nSimon & Savarino, 2007; Sønergård et al., 2006).\nMood - Stabilizing Medications\nIn addition to antipsychotic, antianxiety, and antidepressant drugs, psychiatrists\nhave mood - stabilizing drugs in their arsenal. The simple salt lithium can be an effec-\ntive mood stabilizer for those suffering the emotional highs and lows of bipolar dis-\norder. Australian physician John Cade discovered this in the 1940s when he\nadministered lithium to a patient with severe mania. Although Cade’s reasoning was\nmisguided—he thought lithium had calmed excitable guinea pigs when actually it\nhad made them sick—his patient became perfectly well in less than a week (Snyder,\n1986). After suffering mood swings for years, about 7 in 10 people with bipolar dis-\norder benefit from a long - term daily dose of this cheap salt (Solomon et al., 1995).\nTheir risk of suicide is but one - sixth that of bipolar patients not taking lithium\n(Tondo et al., 1997). \nAlthough we do not fully understand why, lithium works. And so does Depakote,\na drug originally used to treat epilepsy and more recently found effective in the con-\ntrol of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder.\nTHE BIOMEDICAL THERAPIES\n|\nMODULE 36\n| 537\n“Lithium prevents my seductive but\ndisastrous highs, diminishes my\ndepressions, clears out the wool and\nwebbing from my disordered thinking,\nslows me down, gentles me out, keeps\nme from ruining my career and\nrelationships, keeps me out of a\nhospital, alive, and makes\npsychotherapy possible.”\n—Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind,\n1995\n“No twisted thought without a twisted\nmolecule.”\n—Attributed to psychologist Ralph Gerard\n© The New Yorker Collection, 2000, P.

Physicians treated the Roman Emperor\nClaudius (10 B.C.E.–C.E. 54) for headaches by\npressing electric eels to his temples.\nBrain Stimulation\n36-2: How effective is electroconvulsive therapy, and what other brain-\nstimulation options may offer relief from severe depression?\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\nA more controversial brain manipulation occurs through shock treatment, or electro-\nconvulsive therapy (ECT). When ECT was first introduced in 1938, the wide -\n awake patient was strapped to a table and jolted with roughly 100 volts of electricity to\nthe brain, producing racking convulsions and brief unconsciousness. ECT therefore\ngained a barbaric image, one that lingers. Today, however, it is administered with\nbriefer pulses, sometimes only to the brain’s right side and with less memory disrup-\ntion (HMHL, 2007). The patient receives a general anesthetic and a muscle relaxant\n(to prevent injury from convulsions) before a psychiatrist delivers 30 to 60 seconds of\nelectrical current to the patient’s brain (FIGURE 36.3). Within 30 minutes, the patient\nawakens and remembers nothing of the treatment or of the preceding hours. After\nthree such sessions each week for two to four weeks, 80 percent or more of people re-\nceiving ECT improve markedly, showing no discernible brain damage. Study after\nstudy has confirmed that ECT is an effective treatment for severe depression in pa-\ntients who have not responded to drug therapy (Pagnin et al., 2004; UK ECT Review\nGroup, 2003). ECT reduces suicidal thoughts and is credited with saving many from\nsuicide (Kellner et al., 2005). One leading medical journal has concluded that “the re-\nsults of ECT in treating severe depression are among the most positive treatment ef-\nfects in all of medicine” (Glass, 2001).\nHow does ECT alleviate severe depression? After more than 50 years, no one knows\nfor sure. One recipient likened ECT to the smallpox vaccine, which was saving lives be-\nfore we knew how it worked. Perhaps the shock - induced seizures calm neural centers\nwhere overactivity produces depression. ECT, like antidepressant drugs and exercise,\nalso appears to boost the production of new brain cells (Bolwig & Madsen, 2007). \nECG\n(heart rate)\nintravenous line\n(sedative, muscle\nrelaxant)\nto oximeter\n(blood-oxygen\nmonitor)\nblood pressure\ncuff \nblood pressure\ncuff \nrecording\nECT device\nstimulating\nelectrodes\nrecording EEG\nground\nEMG \n(records electrical \nactivity from the muscles)\nFIGURE 36.3 Electroconvulsive therapy\nAlthough controversial, ECT is often an effec-\ntive treatment for depression that does not\nrespond to drug therapy.\nMyEx8eMod_36_MyersEx8e Modules  5/7/10  10:50 AM  Page 538\nECT’s results are not always long lasting. About 4 in 10 ECT-treated patients re-\nlapse into depression within six months (Kellner et al., 2006). Nevertheless, in the\nminds of many psychiatrists and patients, ECT is a lesser evil than severe depres-\nsion’s misery, anguish, and risk of suicide. As research psychologist Norman Endler\n(1982) reported after ECT alleviated his deep depression, “A miracle had hap-\npened in two weeks.”\nAlternative Neurostimulation Therapies\nSome patients with chronic depression have found relief through a chest implant\nthat intermittently stimulates the vagus nerve, which sends signals to the brain’s\nmood - related limbic system (Fitzgerald & Daskalakis, 2008; George & Belmaker,\n2007; Marangell et al., 2007). Two other techniques—deep-brain stimulation and\nmagnetic stimulation—are also raising hopes for gentler alternatives that jump - start\nneural circuits in the depressed brain.\nDeep-Brain Stimulation\nPatients whose depression has resisted both drugs that flood\nthe body and ECT that jolts at least half the brain have ben-\nefited from an experimental treatment pinpointing a brain\ndepression center. Neuroscientist Helen Mayberg and her\ncolleagues (2005, 2006, 2007; Dobbs, 2006) have been fo-\ncusing on a cortex area that bridges the thinking frontal\nlobes to the limbic system. They have discovered that this\narea, which is overactive in the brain of a depressed or tem-\nporarily sad person, becomes calm when treated by ECT or\nantidepressants. \nTo experimentally excite neurons that inhibit this nega-\ntive emotion-feeding activity, Mayberg drew upon the deep-\nbrain stimulation technology sometimes used to treat\ntremors associated with Parkinson’s disease. Among an ini-\ntial 12 patients receiving implanted electrodes and a pacemaker stimulator, 8 ex-\nperienced relief. Some felt suddenly more aware and became more talkative and\nengaged; others improved only slightly if at all. Future research will explore\nwhether Mayberg has discovered a switch that can lift depression. Other researchers\nare following up on reports that deep-brain stimulation can offer relief to people\nwith obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nMagnetic Stimulation\nDepressed moods also seem to improve when repeated pulses surge through a mag-\nnetic coil held close to a person’s skull (FIGURE 36.4 on the next page). Unlike deep-\nbrain stimulation, the magnetic energy penetrates only to the brain’s surface\n(though tests are under way with a higher energy field that penetrates more deeply).\nThe painless procedure—called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(rTMS)—is performed on wide - awake patients over several weeks. Unlike ECT,\nthe rTMS procedure produces no seizures, memory loss, or other side effects. \nIn one double - blind experiment, 67 Israelis with major depression were ran-\ndomly assigned to two groups (Klein et al., 1999). One group received rTMS\ndaily for two  weeks, while the other received sham treatments (without magnetic\nstimulation). At the end of the two weeks, half the stimulated patients showed at\nleast a 50 percent improvement in their scores on a depression scale, as did only\na quarter of the placebo group. One possible explanation is that the stimulation\nenergizes depressed patients’ relatively inactive left frontal lobe (Helmuth,\n2001). When repeatedly stimulated, nerve cells can form functioning circuits\nthrough long - term potentiation (LTP), a process in which a synapse’s firing poten-\ntial increases. \nTHE BIOMEDICAL THERAPIES\n|\nMODULE 36\n| 539\nelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) a bio-\nmedical therapy for severely depressed\npatients in which a brief electric current is\nsent through the brain of an anesthetized\n patient.\nrepetitive transcranial magnetic stimula-\ntion (rTMS) the application of repeated\npulses of magnetic energy to the brain;\nused to stimulate or suppress brain activity.\n© Eric S. Lesser\nA depression switch? By comparing the\nbrains of patients with and without depres-\nsion, researcher Helen Mayberg identified a\nbrain area that appears active in people who\nare depressed or sad, and whose activity may\nbe calmed by deep-brain stimulation.\nMyEx8eMod_36_MyersEx8e Modules  5/7/10  10:50 AM  Page 539\nOther clinical experiments have had mixed results. Some have found little effect\nof rTMS treatment. However, several recent studies using the latest techniques\nhave produced significant relief from depression, as compared with sham treat-\nments (George & Belmaker, 2007; Gross et al., 2007; O’Reardon et al., 2007). \nPsychosurgery\n36-3: What is psychosurgery?\nBecause its effects are irreversible, psychosurgery—surgery that removes or de-\nstroys brain tissue—is the most drastic and the least - used biomedical intervention\nfor changing behavior. In the 1930s, Portuguese physician Egas Moniz developed\nwhat became the best - known psychosurgical operation: the lobotomy. Moniz\nfound that cutting the nerves connecting the frontal lobes with the emotion -\n controlling centers of the inner brain calmed uncontrollably emotional and violent\npatients. In a crude but easy and inexpensive procedure that took only about 10\nminutes, a neurosurgeon would shock the patient into a coma, hammer an icepick-\nlike instrument through each eye socket into the brain, and then wiggle it to sever\nconnections running up to the frontal lobes. Tens of thousands of severely disturbed\npeople—including President John F. Kennedy’s sister, Rosemary—were “loboto-\nmized” between 1936 and 1954, and Moniz was honored with a Nobel Prize\n(Valenstein, 1986).\nAlthough the intention was simply to disconnect emotion from thought, a lobot-\nomy’s effect was often more drastic: It usually decreased the person’s misery or ten-\nsion, but it also produced a permanently lethargic, immature, uncreative person.\nDuring the 1950s, after some 35,000 people had been lobotomized in the United\nStates alone, calming drugs became available and psychosurgery was largely aban-\ndoned. Today, lobotomies are history, and other psychosurgery is used only in ex-\ntreme cases. For example, if a patient suffers uncontrollable seizures, surgeons can\ndeactivate the specific nerve clusters that cause or transmit the convulsions. MRI-\nguided precision surgery is also occasionally done to cut the circuits involved in se-\nvere obsessive - compulsive disorder (Sachdev & Sachdev, 1997). Because these\nprocedures are irreversible, however, neurosurgeons perform them only as a last\n resort.\n540\n|\nMODULE 36\n|\nTHE BIOMEDICAL THERAPIES\nPulsed\nmagnetic\nfield\nWire coil\nPositioning\nframe\nResting\nneurons\nActivated\nneurons\nMagnetic\nfield\nMaximum\nfield depth\nFIGURE 36.4 Magnets for the mind\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(rTMS) sends a painless magnetic field\nthrough the skull to the surface of the cortex.\nPulses can be used to stimulate or dampen\nactivity in various cortical areas.

Every thought and feeling\ndepends on the functioning brain. Every creative idea, every moment of joy or\nanger, every period of depression emerges from the electrochemical activity of the\nliving brain. The influence is two - way: When psychotherapy relieves obsessive -\n compulsive behavior, PET scans reveal a calmer brain (Schwartz et al., 1996).\nFor years, we have trusted our bodies to physicians and our minds to psychia-\ntrists and psychologists. That neat separation no longer seems valid. Stress affects\nbody chemistry and health. And chemical imbalances, whatever their cause, can\nproduce psychological disorders. \nThat lesson is being applied by Stephen Ilardi and his colleagues (2008) in their\ntraining seminars promoting therapeutic life-style change. Human brains and bodies\nwere designed for physical activity and social engagement, they note. Our ancestors\nhunted, gathered, and built in groups, with little evidence of disabling depression.\nIndeed, those whose way of life entails strenuous physical activity, strong commu-\nnity ties, sunlight exposure, and plenty of sleep (think of foraging bands in Papua\nNew Guinea, or Amish farming communities in North America) rarely experience\nmajor depression. “Simply put: Humans were never designed for the sedentary, dis-\nengaged, socially isolated, poorly nourished, sleep-deprived pace of twenty-first-\ncentury American life.”\nOther studies confirm that exercise reduces depression and anxiety and is there-\nfore a useful adjunct to antidepressant drugs and psychotherapy (Dunn et al., 2005;\nStathopoulou et al., 2006). Not only is exercise about as effective as drugs, some re-\nsearch suggests it better prevents symptom recurrence (Babyak et al., 2000;\nSalmon, 2001).\nThe Ilardi team was impressed by this research showing that regular aerobic ex-\nercise and a complete night’s sleep boost mood and energy. So they invited small\ngroups of people with depression to undergo a 12-week training program with the\nfollowing goals:\n\u0002 Aerobic exercise, 30 minutes a day, at least three times weekly (increases fitness\nand vitality, stimulates endorphins)\n\u0002 Adequate sleep, with a goal of 7 to 8 hours a night (increases energy and alert-\nness, boosts immunity)\n\u0002 Light exposure, at least 30 minutes each morning with a light box (amplifies\narousal, influences hormones)\n\u0002 Social connection, with less alone time and at least two meaningful social\nengagements weekly (helps satisfy the human need to belong)\n\u0002 Anti-rumination, by identifying and redirecting negative thoughts (enhances\npositive thinking)\n\u0002 Nutritional supplements, including a daily fish oil supplement with omega-3 fatty\nacids (aids in healthy brain functioning)\nIn one study of 74 people, 77 percent of those who completed the program expe-\nrienced relief from depressive symptoms, compared with a 19 percent rate in those\nassigned to a treatment-as-usual control condition. Future research will seek to\nreplicate this striking result of life-style change and to identify which of the treat-\nment components (some of which are part of other therapies) produce the thera-\npeutic effect. But there seems little reason to doubt the truth of the Latin adage,\nMens sana in corpore sano: “A healthy mind in a healthy body.”\nTHE BIOMEDICAL THERAPIES\n|\nMODULE 36\n| 541\nBody \nMind \nFIGURE 36.5 Mind - body interaction The\nbiomedical therapies assume that mind and\nbody are a unit: Affect one and you will affect\nthe other.\n“Mental disorders arise from physical\nones, and likewise physical disorders\narise from mental ones.”\n—The Mahabharata, C.E. 200\nMyEx8eMod_36_MyersEx8e Modules  5/7/10  10:50 AM  Page 541\n542\n36-1: What are the drug therapies? What criticisms have been\nleveled against drug therapies? The biomedical therapies treat psy-\nchological disorders with medications or medical procedures that\nact directly on the nervous system. Drug therapy, the most widely\nused biomedical therapy, alters brain chemistry, often by decreas-\ning or increasing the available supply of particular neurotransmit-\nters. Many antipsychotic drugs, used in treating schizophrenia, block\ndopamine activity, and some can have serious side effects.\nAntianxiety drugs, which depress central nervous system activity, are\nused to treat anxiety disorders. These drugs can be physically and\npsychologically addictive. Antidepressant drugs, which increase the\navailability of serotonin and norepinephrine, are now used to treat\nanxiety as well as depression. Their full effect may not be felt for\nseveral weeks, and their effect is generally modest. Lithium and\nDepakote are mood stabilizers prescribed for those with bipolar\ndisorder.\n36-2: How effective is electroconvulsive therapy, and what\nother brain-stimulation options may offer relief from severe\ndepression?

Psychosurgery removes or destroys\nbrain tissue in hopes of modifying behavior. The once-popular psy-\nchosurgery known as lobotomy proved to be dangerous and too rad-\nical. Neurosurgeons now rarely perform brain surgery to change\nbehavior or moods. Brain surgery is a treatment of last resort\nbecause its effects are irreversible.\n36-4: How, by caring for their bodies with a healthy life-style,\nmight people find some relief from depression?

    "content": "47\nOlder Brain Structures\nThe Cerebral Cortex\nOur Divided Brain\nThe Brain\nWhen you think about your brain, you’re thinking with your brain—sending billions\nof neurotransmitter molecules across countless millions of synapses. Indeed, say\nneuroscientists, the mind is what the brain does.\nEven in a motionless body, the brain—and mind—may, in some cases, be active.\nOne 23-year-old woman showed no outward signs of conscious awareness after a\ntraffic accident. Nevertheless, when researchers asked her to imagine playing tennis\nor moving around her home, brain scans revealed activity like that of healthy volun-\nteers (Owen et al., 2006). As she imagined playing tennis, for example, an area of\nher brain controlling arm and leg movements became active. \nA century ago, scientists had no tools high - powered yet gentle enough to reveal\nsuch activity in a living human brain. Clinical observations had unveiled some\nbrain-mind connections. Physicians noted, for example, that damage to one side of\nthe brain often caused numbness or paralysis on the body’s opposite side, suggest-\ning that the body’s right side is wired to the brain’s left side, and vice versa. Others\nnoticed that damage to the back of the brain disrupted vision, and that damage to\nthe left - front part of the brain produced speech difficulties. Gradually, these early\nexplorers were mapping the brain.\nNow, within a lifetime, the whole brain-mapping process has changed. The known\nuniverse’s most amazing organ is being probed and mapped by a new generation of\nneural mapmakers. Their techniques for peering into the thinking, feeling brain are\ndoing for psychology what the microscope did for biology and the telescope did for\nastronomy. Close-Up: The Tools of Discovery—Having Our Head Examined on the\nnext page looks at some techniques that enable neuroscientists to study the working\nbrain.\nOlder Brain Structures\n4-1: What are the functions of important lower-level brain structures?\nIndicators of an animal’s capacities come from its brain structures. In primitive ani-\nmals, such as sharks, a not-so-complex brain primarily regulates basic survival func-\ntions: breathing, resting, and feeding. In lower mammals, such as rodents, a more\ncomplex brain enables emotion and greater memory. In advanced mammals, such\nas humans, a brain that processes more information enables foresight as well.\nThis increasing complexity arises from new brain systems built on top of the old,\nmuch as the Earth’s landscape covers the old with the new. Digging down, one dis-\ncovers the fossil remnants of the past—brainstem components performing for us\nmuch as they did for our distant ancestors. Let’s start with the brain’s basement and\nwork up to the newer systems.\nThe Brainstem\nThe brain’s oldest and innermost region is the brainstem. It begins where the\nspinal cord swells slightly after entering the skull. This slight swelling is the\nmedulla. Here lie the controls for your heartbeat and breathing. Just above the\nmedulla sits the pons, which helps coordinate movements. If a cat’s brainstem is sev-\nered from the rest of the brain above it, the animal will still breathe and live—and\neven run, climb, and groom (Klemm, 1990). But cut off from the brain’s higher re-\ngions, it won’t purposefully run or climb to  get food. \nThe brainstem is a crossover point, where most nerves to and from each side of\nthe brain connect with the body’s opposite side. This peculiar cross - wiring is but\none of the brain’s many surprises.\n\nMODULE\n4\nbrainstem the oldest part and central core\nof the brain, beginning where the spinal\ncord swells as it enters the skull; the brain-\nstem is responsible for automatic survival\nfunctions.\nmedulla [muh - DUL-uh]  the base of the\nbrainstem; controls heartbeat and breathing.\nBanking brains Francine Benes, director of\nMcLean Hospital’s Brain Bank, sees the collec-\ntion as a valuable database.\nTom Landers/Boston Globe\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 47\nThe Tools of Discovery—Having Our Head Examined\nby the red arrows in FIGURE 4.3)—in some\npatients with schizophrenia, a disabling\npsychological disorder.\nA special application of MRI—fMRI\n(functional MRI)—can reveal the brain’s\nfunctioning as well as its structure. Where\nthe brain is especially active, blood goes.\nBy comparing MRI scans taken less than a\nsecond apart, researchers can watch the\nbrain “light up” (with increased oxygen -\nladen bloodflow) as a person performs dif-\nferent mental functions. As the person looks\nat a scene, for example, the fMRI machine\ndetects blood rushing to the back of the\nbrain, which processes visual information\n(see Figure 4.14, in the discussion of cortex\nfunctions). Such snapshots of the brain’s\nchanging activity are providing new\ninsights into how the brain divides its labor.\nTo be learning about the neurosciences\nnow is like studying world geography while\nMagellan was exploring the seas. This truly\nis the golden age of brain  science.\nClose-Up:\n4-2: How do neuroscientists study\nthe brain’s connections to behavior\nand mind?\nWhether in the interests of science or med-\nicine, today’s scientists can selectively\nlesion (destroy) tiny clusters of normal or\ndefective brain cells, leaving the surround-\ning tissue unharmed. They can snoop on\nthe messages of individual neurons, using\nmodern microelectrodes with tips so small\nthey can detect the electrical pulse in a\nsingle neuron. For example, we can now\ndetect exactly where the information goes\nin a cat’s brain when someone strokes its\n whisker. They can also electrically, chemi-\ncally, or magnetically stimulate various\nparts of the brain and note the effects;\neavesdrop on the chatter of billions of\nneurons; and see color representations of\nthe brain’s energy - consuming activity.\nRight now, your mental activity is giv-\ning off telltale electrical, metabolic, and\nmagnetic signals that neuroscientists\ncould trap to observe your brain at work.\nFor example, electrical activity in your\nbrain’s billions of neurons sweeps in regu-\nlar waves across its surface. An electroen-\ncephalogram (EEG) will give an amplified\nread - out of such waves (FIGURE 4.1).\n“You must look into people, as well as at\nthem,” advised Lord Chesterfield in a 1746\nletter to his son. Newer windows into the\nbrain give us that Supermanlike ability to\nsee inside a living brain. One such tool,\nthe PET (positron emission tomography)\nscan (FIGURE 4.2), depicts brain activity\nby showing each brain area’s consumption\nof its chemical fuel, the sugar glucose.\nActive neurons are glucose hogs, and after\na person receives temporarily radioactive\nglucose, the PET scan can track the gamma\nrays released by this “food for thought” as\nthe person performs a given task. Rather\nlike weather radar showing rain activity,\nPET scan “hot spots” show which brain\nareas are most active as the person does\nmathematical calculations, looks at images\nof faces, or daydreams.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging)\ncan also be used to scan the brain or other\nbody parts. In MRI brain scans, the per-\nson’s head is put in a strong magnetic\nfield, which aligns the spinning atoms of\nbrain molecules. Then a radio wave pulse\nmomentarily disorients the atoms. When\nthe atoms return to their normal spin, they\nrelease signals that provide a detailed pic-\nture of the brain’s soft tissues. MRI scans\nhave revealed a larger - than - average neural\narea in the left hemisphere of musicians\nwho display perfect pitch (Schlaug et al.,\n1995). They have also revealed enlarged\nventricles—fluid - filled brain areas (marked\nFIGURE 4.1 An electroencephalograph\nproviding amplified tracings of waves\nof electrical activity in the brain Here it\nis displaying the brain activity of this 4-year-\nold who has epilepsy.\nFIGURE 4.2 The PET scan To obtain a PET\nscan, researchers inject volunteers with a low\nand harmless dose of a short - lived radioactive\nsugar.

This joined pair of\negg - shaped structures acts as the brain’s sensory switchboard. It receives informa-\ntion from all the senses except smell and routes it to the higher brain regions that\ndeal with seeing, hearing, tasting, and touching. Think of the thalamus as being to\nsensory input what London is to England’s trains: a hub through which traffic\npasses en route to various destinations. The thalamus also receives some of the\nhigher brain’s replies, which it then directs to the medulla and to the cerebellum.\nThe Reticular Formation\nInside the brainstem, between your ears, lies the reticular (“netlike”) formation,\na finger - shaped network of neurons that extends from the spinal cord right up\nthrough the thalamus. As the spinal cord’s sensory input travels up to the thalamus,\nsome of it travels through the reticular formation, which filters incoming stimuli\nand relays important information to other areas of the brain.\nIn 1949, Giuseppe Moruzzi and Horace Magoun discovered that electrically\nstimulating the reticular formation of a sleeping cat almost instantly produced an\nawake, alert animal. When Magoun severed a cat’s reticular formation from higher\nbrain regions, without damaging the nearby sensory pathways, the effect was\nequally dramatic: The cat lapsed into a coma from which it never awakened. The\nreticular formation affects arousal.\nThe Cerebellum\nExtending from the rear of the brainstem is the baseball - sized cerebellum, meaning\n“little brain,” which is what its two wrinkled halves resemble (FIGURE 4.5 on the next\npage). The cerebellum enables one type of nonverbal learning and memory. It helps\nus judge time, modulate our emotions, and discriminate sounds and textures (Bower\n& Parsons, 2003). It also coordinates voluntary movement. When soccer great David\nBeckham fires the ball into the net with a perfectly timed kick, give his cerebellum\nsome credit. If you injured your cerebellum, you would have difficulty walking, keep-\ning your balance, or shaking hands. Your movements would be jerky and exagger-\nated. Under alcohol’s influence on the cerebellum, walking may lack coordination, as\nmany a driver has learned after being pulled over and given a roadside test.\nTHE BRAIN\n|\nMODULE 4\n| 49\nthalamus [THAL-uh - muss]  the brain’s\nsensory switchboard, located on top of the\nbrainstem; it directs messages to the senso-\nry receiving areas in the cortex and trans-\nmits replies to the cerebellum and medulla.\nreticular formation a nerve network in the\nbrainstem that plays an important role in\ncontrolling arousal.\ncerebellum [sehr - uh - BELL-um]  the “little\nbrain” at the rear of the brainstem; func-\ntions include some nonverbal learning, pro-\ncessing sensory input, and coordinating\nmovement output and balance.\nThalamus\nReticular\nformation\nPons\nMedulla\nBrainstem\nFIGURE 4.4 The brainstem and \nthalamus The brainstem, including the\npons and medulla, is an extension of the\nspinal cord.

This il-\nlustrates another of our recurring themes: Our brain processes most information outside\nof our awareness. We are aware of the results of our brain’s labor (say, our current vi-\nsual experience) but not of how we construct the visual image. Likewise, whether we\nare asleep or awake, our brainstem manages its life - sustaining functions, freeing our\nnewer brain regions to think, talk, dream, or savor  a  memory.\nThe Limbic System\nAt the border (“limbus”) between the\nbrain’s older parts and the cerebral hemi-\nspheres—the two halves of the brain—is\nthe limbic system (FIGURE 4.6). One\nlimbic system component, the hip-\npocampus, processes memory: If ani-\nmals or humans lose their hippocampus\nto surgery or injury, they become un-\nable to process new memories of facts\nand episodes. For now, let’s look at the\nlimbic system’s links to emotions (such\nas fear and anger) and to basic motives\n(such as those for food  and sex).\nThe Amygdala\nIn the limbic system, two lima-bean– sized neural clusters, the amygdala, influence\naggression and fear (FIGURE 4.7). In 1939, psychologist Heinrich Klüver and neuro-\nsurgeon Paul Bucy surgically lesioned the part of a rhesus monkey’s brain that in-\ncluded the amygdala. The result? The formerly ill - tempered monkey turned into the\nmost mellow of creatures. Poke it, pinch it, do virtually anything that normally\nwould trigger a ferocious response, and still the animal remained placid. What then\nmight happen if we electrically stimulated the amygdala in a normally placid do-\nmestic animal, such as a cat? Do so in one spot and the cat prepares to attack, hiss-\ning with its back arched, its pupils dilated, its hair on end (FIGURE 4.8). Move the\nelectrode only slightly within the amygdala, cage the cat with a small mouse, and\nnow it cowers in  terror.\nThese experiments confirm the amygdala’s role in rage and fear, including the\nperception of these emotions and the processing of emotional memories (Anderson\n& Phelps, 2000; Poremba & Gabriel, 2001). Still, we must be careful. The brain is\nnot neatly organized into structures that correspond to our categories of behavior.\nCerebellum\nSpinal cord\nFIGURE 4.5 The brain’s organ of  agility\nHanging at the back of the brain, the cerebel-\nlum coordinates our voluntary movements, as\nwhen David Beckham directs the ball precisely.\nLluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images\n“Consciousness is a small part of what\nthe brain does.”\n—Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux, in\n“Mastery of Emotions,” 2006\nHypothalamus\nPituitary gland\nAmygdala\nHippocampus\nFIGURE 4.6 The limbic system This neural\nsystem sits between the brain’s older parts and\nits cerebral hemispheres.

Even\nwithin the limbic system, stimulating structures other than the amygdala can evoke\nsuch behavior. If you charge your car’s dead battery, you can activate the engine. Yet\nthe battery is merely one link in an integrated  system that makes a car go.\nThe Hypothalamus\nJust below (hypo) the thalamus is the hypothalamus (FIGURE 4.9), an important link\nin the chain of command governing bodily maintenance. Some neural clusters in\nthe hypothalamus influence hunger; others regulate thirst, body temperature, and\nsexual  behavior.\nThe hypothalamus both monitors blood chemistry and takes orders from other\nparts of the brain. For example, thinking about sex (in your brain’s cerebral cortex)\ncan stimulate your hypothalamus to secrete hormones. These hormones in turn\ntrigger the adjacent “master gland,” the pituitary (see Figure 4.6), to influence hor-\nmones released by other glands. (Notice the interplay between the nervous and en-\ndocrine systems: The brain influences the endocrine system, which in turn\ninfluences the brain.)\nA remarkable discovery about the hypothalamus illustrates how progress in sci-\nence often occurs—when curious, open - minded investigators make an unexpected\nobservation. Two young McGill University neuropsychologists, James Olds and\nPeter Milner (1954), were trying to implant an electrode in a rat’s reticular forma-\ntion when they made a magnificent mistake: They incorrectly placed the electrode\nin what they later discovered was a region of the rat’s hypothalamus (Olds, 1975).\nCuriously, as if seeking more stimulation, the rat kept returning to the location\nwhere it had been stimulated by this misplaced electrode. On discovering their mis-\ntake, Olds and Milner alertly realized they had stumbled upon a brain center that\nprovides a pleasurable  reward.\nIn a meticulous series of experiments, Olds (1958) went on to locate other “plea-\nsure centers,” as he called them. (What the rats actually experience only they know,\nand they aren’t telling. Rather than attribute human feelings to rats, today’s scien-\ntists refer to reward centers, not “pleasure centers.”) When allowed to press pedals to\ntrigger their own stimulation in these areas, rats would sometimes do so at a feverish\npace—up to 7000 times per hour—until they dropped from exhaustion. Moreover,\nto get this stimulation, they would even cross an electrified floor that a starving rat\nwould not cross to reach food (FIGURE 4.10).\nReward centers in nearby brain areas were later discovered in many other\nspecies, including goldfish, dolphins, and monkeys. In fact, animal research has re-\nvealed both a general reward system that triggers the release of the neurotransmitter\ndopamine, and distributed specific centers associated with the pleasures of eating,\ndrinking, and sex. Animals, it seems, come equipped with built - in systems that re-\nward activities essential to  survival.\nTHE BRAIN\n|\nMODULE 4\n| 51\nFIGURE 4.7 The amygdala\nFIGURE 4.8 Aggression as a brain state\nBack arched and fur fluffed, this fierce cat is\nready to attack.

Indeed we do. To calm vi-\nolent patients, one neurosurgeon implanted electrodes in such areas. Stimulated\npatients reported mild pleasure; however, unlike Olds’ rats, they were not driven\nto a frenzy (Deutsch, 1972; Hooper & Teresi, 1986). Some researchers believe\nthat addictive disorders, such as alcohol dependence, substance abuse, and binge\neating, may stem from a reward deficiency syndrome—a genetically disposed defi-\nciency in the natural brain systems for pleasure and well - being that leads people\nto crave whatever provides that missing pleasure or relieves negative feelings\n(Blum et al., 1996). \nFIGURE 4.11 locates the brain areas we have discussed, as well as the cerebral cor-\ntex, our next topic.\nThe Cerebral Cortex\nOlder brain networks sustain basic life functions and enable memory, emotions,\nand basic drives. Newer neural networks within the cerebrum—the two large hemi-\nspheres that contribute 85 percent of the brain’s weight—form specialized work\nteams that enable our perceiving, thinking, and speaking. Covering those hemi-\nspheres, like bark on a tree, is the cerebral cortex, a thin surface layer of intercon-\nnected neural cells. It is your brain’s thinking crown, your body’s ultimate control\nand information - processing center. \nAs we move up the ladder of animal life, the cerebral cortex expands, tight ge-\nnetic controls relax, and the organism’s adaptability increases. Frogs and other am-\nphibians with a small cortex operate extensively on preprogrammed genetic\ninstructions. The larger cortex of mammals offers increased capacities for learning\nand thinking, enabling them to be more adaptable. \n52\n|\nMODULE 4\n|\nTHE BRAIN\n“If you were designing a robot vehicle\nto walk into the future and\nsurvive, . . . you’d wire it up so that\nbehavior that ensured the survival of\nthe self or the species—like sex and\neating—would be naturally\nreinforcing.”\n—Candace Pert (1986)\nLeft hemisphere\nRight hemisphere\nCorpus callosum:\naxon fibers connecting the\ntwo cerebral hemispheres\nThalamus:\nrelays messages between\nlower brain centers\nand cerebral cortex\nPituitary:\nmaster endocrine gland\nCerebellum:\ncoordinates voluntary\nmovement and balance\nand supports memories\nof such\nCerebral cortex\nLimbic system\nBrainstem\nCerebral cortex:\nultimate control and\ninformation-processing\ncenter\nHypothalamus:\ncontrols maintenance\nfunctions such as eating;\nhelps govern endocrine\nsystem; linked to emotion\nand reward\nReticular formation:\nhelps control arousal\nMedulla:\ncontrols heartbeat and\nbreathing\nSpinal cord:\npathway for neural fibers\ntraveling to and from brain;\ncontrols simple reflexes\nAmygdala:\nlinked to\nemotion\nHippocampus:\nlinked to\nmemory\nFIGURE 4.11 Brain structures and their\nfunctions\nThe people who first dissected and labeled the\nbrain used the language of scholars—Latin\nand Greek.

Without these wrinkles, a\nflattened cerebral cortex would require triple the area—roughly that of a very large\npizza. The brain’s ballooning left and right hemispheres are filled mainly with axons\nconnecting the cortex to the brain’s other regions. The cerebral cortex—that thin\nsurface layer—contains some 20 to 23 billion nerve cells and 300 trillion synaptic\nconnections (de Courten-Myers, 2005). Being human takes a lot of nerve.\nStepping back to consider the whole cortex, you would see that each hemisphere is\ndivided into four lobes, geographic subdivisions separated by prominent fissures, or folds\n(FIGURE 4.12). Starting at the front of your brain and moving over the top, there are the\nfrontal lobes (behind your forehead), the parietal lobes (at the top and to the rear),\nand the occipital lobes (at the back of your head). Reversing direction and moving\nforward, just above your ears, you find the temporal lobes. Each of the four lobes car-\nries out many functions, and many functions require the interplay of several lobes.\nFunctions of the Cortex\n4-4: What are the functions of the cerebral cortex?\nMore than a century ago, autopsies of people who had been partially paralyzed or\nspeechless revealed damaged cortical areas. But this rather crude evidence did not\nconvince researchers that specific parts of the cortex perform specific complex\nfunctions. After all, if control of speech and movement were diffused across the cor-\ntex, damage to almost any area might produce the same effect. A television with its\npower cord cut would go dead, but we would be fooling ourselves if we thought we\nhad “localized” the picture in  the cord.\nMotor Functions\nScientists had better luck in localizing simpler brain functions. For example, in\n1870, when German physicians Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig applied mild\nelectrical stimulation to parts of a dog’s cortex, they made an important discovery:\nThey could make parts of its body move. The effects were selective. Stimulation\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 53\ncaused movement only when applied to an arch - shaped region at the back of the\nfrontal lobes, running roughly ear-to-ear across the top of the brain. Moreover,\nstimulating parts of this region in the left or right hemisphere caused movements of\nspecific body parts on the opposite side of  the body. Fritsch and Hitzig had discov-\nered what is now called the motor cortex.\nMapping the Motor Cortex\nLuckily for brain surgeons and their patients, the brain has no sensory receptors.\nKnowing this, Otfrid Foerster and Wilder Penfield in the 1930s were able to map\nthe motor cortex in hundreds of wide - awake patients by stimulating different corti-\ncal areas and observing the body’s responses. They discovered that body areas re-\nquiring precise control, such as the fingers and mouth, occupied the greatest\namount of cortical space.\nSpanish neuroscientist José Delgado repeatedly demonstrated the mechanics of\nmotor behavior. In one human patient, he stimulated a spot on the left motor cortex\nthat triggered the right hand to make a fist. Asked to keep the fingers open during the\nnext stimulation, the patient, whose fingers closed despite his best efforts, remarked, “I\nguess, Doctor, that your electricity is stronger than my will” (Delgado, 1969, p. 114).\nMore recently, scientists have been able to predict a monkey’s arm motion a\ntenth of a second before it moves—by repeatedly measuring motor cortex activity\npreceding specific arm movements (Gibbs, 1996). Such findings have opened the\ndoor to a new generation of prosthetics (artificial body part replacements).\nSensory Functions\nIf the motor cortex sends messages out to the body, where does the cortex receive\nthe incoming messages? Penfield also identified the cortical area that specializes in\nreceiving information from the skin senses and from the movement of body parts.\nThis area at the front of the parietal lobes, parallel to and just behind the motor cor-\ntex, we now call the sensory cortex. (FIGURE 4.13 outlines both the motor cortex\n54\n|\nMODULE 4\n|\nTHE BRAIN\nToes\nAnkle\nKnee\nHip\nTrunk\nArm\nWrist\nFingers\nThumb\nNeck\nBrow\nEye\nFace\nLips\nJaw\nTongue\nSwallowing\nToes\nGenitals\nFoot\nLeg\nKnee\nHip\nTrunk\nArm\nHand\nFingers\nThumb\nNeck\nEye\nNose\nFace\nLips\nJaw\nGums\nTeeth\nTongue\nOutput: Motor cortex\n(Left-hemisphere section\ncontrols the body’s right side)\nInput: Sensory cortex\n(Left-hemisphere section receives\ninput from the body’s right side)\nFIGURE 4.13 Left-hemisphere tissue\ndevoted to each body part in the\nmotor cortex and the sensory cortex As\nyou can see from this classic though inexact\nrepresentation, the amount of cortex devoted\nto a body part is not proportional to that\npart’s size. Rather, the brain devotes more tis-\nsue to sensitive areas and to areas requiring\nprecise control. Thus, the fingers have a\ngreater representation in the cortex than does\nthe upper arm.\nDemonstration: Try moving your right\nhand in a circular motion, as if polishing a\ntable. Now start your right foot doing the\nsame motion synchronized with the hand.\nNow reverse the foot motion (but not the\nhand). Tough, huh? But easier if you try\nmoving the left foot opposite to the right\nhand. The left and right limbs are controlled\nby opposite sides of the brain, so their opposed\nactivities interfere less with each other.\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 54\nand the sensory cortex.) Stimulate a point on\nthe top of this band of tissue and a person\nmay report being touched on the shoulder;\nstimulate some point on the side and the per-\nson may feel something on  the face.\nThe more sensitive the body region, the\nlarger the sensory cortex area devoted to it.\nYour supersensitive lips project to a larger\nbrain area than do your toes, which is one rea-\nson we kiss with our lips rather than touch\ntoes. Rats have a large brain area devoted to\ntheir whisker sensations, and owls to their\nhearing  sensations.\nScientists have identified additional areas where the cortex receives input from\nsenses other than touch. At this moment, you are receiving visual information in the vi-\nsual cortex in your occipital lobes, at the very back of your brain (FIGURES 4.14 and 4.15).\nA bad enough bash there would make you blind. Stimulated there, you might see\nflashes of light or dashes of color. (In a sense, we do have eyes in the back of our head!)\nFrom your occipital lobes, visual information goes to other areas that specialize in tasks\nsuch as identifying words, detecting emotions, and recognizing faces.\nAny sound you now hear is processed by your auditory cortex in your temporal\nlobes (Figure 4.15). (If you think of your clenched fist as your brain, and hold it in\nfront of you, your thumb would roughly correspond to one of your temporal lobes.)\nMost of this auditory information travels a circuitous route from one ear to the audi-\ntory receiving area above your opposite ear. If stimulated there, you might hear a\nsound. MRI scans of people with schizophrenia reveal active auditory areas in the tem-\nporal lobes during auditory hallucinations (Lennox et al., 1999). Even the phantom\nringing sound experienced by people with hearing loss is—if heard in one ear—associ-\nated with activity in the temporal lobe on the brain’s opposite side (Muhlnickel, 1998).\nAssociation Areas\nSo far, we have pointed out small areas of the cortex that either receive sensory\ninput or direct muscular output. In humans, that leaves a full three - fourths of the\nthin, wrinkled layer, the cerebral cortex, uncommitted to sensory or motor activity.\nWhat, then, goes on in this vast region of the brain? Neurons in these association\nareas (the peach-colored areas in FIGURE 4.16) integrate information. They link sen-\nsory inputs with stored memories—a very important part of  thinking.\nElectrically probing the association areas doesn’t trigger any observable re-\nsponse. So, unlike the sensory and motor areas, association area functions cannot\nbe neatly mapped. Their silence has led to what Donald McBurney (1996, p. 44)\ncalled “one of the hardiest weeds in the garden of psychology”: the claim that we\nordinarily use only 10 percent of our brains. (If true, wouldn’t this imply a 90 per-\ncent chance that a bullet to your brain would land in an unused area?)

Rather, these areas interpret, integrate, and act on information\nprocessed by the sensory areas.\nAssociation areas are found in all four lobes. In the frontal lobes, they enable\njudgment, planning, and processing of new memories. People with damaged frontal\nlobes may have intact memories, high scores on intelligence tests, and great cake-\nbaking skills. Yet they would not be able to plan ahead to begin baking a cake for a\nbirthday party (Huey et al., 2006).\nFrontal lobe damage also can alter personality, removing a person’s inhibi-\ntions. Consider the classic case of railroad worker Phineas Gage. One afternoon\nin 1848, Gage, then 25 years old, was packing gunpowder into a rock with a\ntamping iron. A spark ignited the gunpowder, shooting the rod up through his left\ncheek and out the top of his skull, leaving his frontal lobes massively damaged\n(FIGURE 4.17). To everyone’s amazement, he was immediately able to sit up and\nspeak, and after the wound healed he returned  to work. But the affable, soft -\n spoken Phineas Gage was now irritable, profane, and dishonest. Although his\nmental abilities and memories were intact, his personality was not. This person,\nsaid his friends, was “no longer Gage.” He eventually lost his job and ended up\nearning his living as a fairground exhibit. \nWith his frontal lobes ruptured, Gage’s moral compass had disconnected from\nhis  behavior. Similar impairments to moral judgment have appeared in more recent\nstudies of people with damaged frontal lobes. Not only may they become less inhib-\nited (without the frontal lobe brakes on their impulses), but their moral judgments\nseem unrestrained by normal emotions. Would you advocate pushing someone in\nfront of a runaway boxcar to save five others? Most people do not, but those with\ndamage to a brain area behind the eyes often do (Koenigs et al., 2007).\nAssociation areas also perform other mental functions. In the parietal lobes,\nparts of which were large and unusually shaped in Albert Einstein’s normal - weight\nbrain, they enable mathematical and spatial reasoning (Witelson et al., 1999). An\narea on the underside of the right temporal lobe enables us to recognize faces. If a\nstroke or head injury destroyed this area of your brain, you would still be able to\ndescribe facial features and to recognize someone’s gender and approximate age,\nyet be strangely unable to identify the person as, say, Jack Black, or even your\ngrandmother. \nLanguage: Specialization and Integration\nWe think of speaking and reading, or writing and reading, or singing and speaking\nas merely different examples of the same general ability—language. But consider\nthis curious finding: Aphasia, an impaired use of language, can result from dam-\nage to any one of several cortical areas. Even more curious, some people with\naphasia can speak fluently but cannot read (despite good vision), while others can\ncomprehend what they read but cannot speak. Still others can write but not read,\nread but not write, read numbers but not letters, or sing but not speak. What does\nthis tell us about the mystery of how we use language, and how did researchers\nsolve this mystery? \nClue 1 In 1865, French physician Paul Broca reported that after damage to a\nspecific area of the left frontal lobe (later called Broca’s area) a person would\nstruggle to speak words while still being able to sing familiar songs and com-\nprehend  speech. Damage to Broca’s area disrupts speaking.\nClue 2 In 1874, German investigator Carl Wernicke discovered that after dam-\nage to a specific area of the left temporal lobe (Wernicke’s area) people could\nspeak only meaningless words. Asked to describe a picture that showed two\nboys stealing cookies behind a woman’s back, one patient responded: “Mother\nis away her working her work to get her better, but when she’s looking the two\nboys looking the other part. She’s working another time” (Geschwind, 1979).\nDamage to Wernicke’s area also disrupts understanding.\n56\n|\nMODULE 4\n|\nTHE BRAIN\nFIGURE 4.17 Phineas Gage reconsidered\n(a) Using measurements of his skull (which\nwas kept as a medical record) and modern\nneuro imaging techniques, researcher Hanna\nDamasio and her colleagues (1994) recon-\nstructed the probable path of the rod through\nGage’s brain.

It\nreceives visual information from the visual area and recodes it into an auditory\nform, which Wernicke’s area uses to derive its  meaning. Damage to the angular\ngyrus leaves a person able to speak and understand, but unable to read.\nClue 4 Nerve fibers interconnect these brain areas.\nAlmost a century after Broca’s and Wernicke’s findings, Norman Geschwind as-\nsembled these and other clues into an explanation of how distinct neural networks\nin our brain enable language (FIGURES 4.18 and 4.19). When you read aloud, the\nwords (1) register in the visual area, (2) are relayed to the angular gyrus, which\ntransforms the words into an auditory code that (3) is received and understood in\nthe nearby Wernicke’s area, and (4) is sent to Broca’s area, which (5) controls the\nmotor cortex as it creates the pronounced word. Depending on which link in this\nchain is damaged, a different form of aphasia occurs. \nThe big point to remember is this: In processing language, as in other forms of informa-\ntion processing, the brain operates by dividing its mental functions—speaking, perceiving,\nthinking, remembering—into subfunctions. Your conscious experience of reading this\nTHE BRAIN\n|\nMODULE 4\n| 57\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 57\npage seems indivisible, but your brain is computing each word’s form, sound, and\nmeaning using different neural networks (Posner & Carr, 1992). This division of\nlabor appears again and again—for example, in the way the brain processes visual\ninformation.\nThese specialized language networks help explain a funny finding. Functional\nMRI scans show that we process jokes playing on meaning (“Why don’t sharks bite\nlawyers? . . . Professional courtesy”) in a different brain area than jokes playing on\nwords (“What kind of lights did Noah use on the ark? . . . Flood lights”) (Goel &\nDolan, 2001). Think about it: What you experience as a continuous, indivisible stream of\nexperience is actually but the visible tip of a subdivided information - processing iceberg,\nmost of which lies beneath the surface of your awareness.\nTo sum up, the mind’s subsystems are localized in particular brain regions, yet\nthe brain acts as a unified whole. Moving your hand, recognizing faces, perceiving\nscenes, comprehending language—all depend on specific neural networks. Yet com-\nplex functions such as listening, learning, and loving involve the coordination of\nmany brain areas. Together, these two principles—specialization and integration—\ndescribe the brain’s functioning.\nThe Brain’s Plasticity\n4-5: To what extent can a damaged brain reorganize itself?\nOur brains are sculpted not only by our genes but also by our experiences. Other\nmodules discuss developmental research that demonstrates how experience molds\nthe brain. In this module, we focus on the brain’s plasticity, its ability to modify it-\nself after some types of damage.\nUnlike cut skin, severed neurons usually do not regenerate (if your spinal cord\nwere severed, you would probably be permanently paralyzed). And some very spe-\ncific brain functions seem preassigned to particular areas. One newborn who suf-\nfered damage to the facial recognition areas on both temporal lobes never regained\na normal ability to recognize faces (Farah et al., 2000). But there is good news:\nSome neural tissue can reorganize in response to damage. It happens within all of us,\nas the brain repairs itself after little mishaps. \nOur brains are most plastic when we are young children (Kolb, 1989; see also\nFIGURE 4.20). The brain’s plasticity is good news for those blind or deaf. Blindness or\ndeafness makes unused brain areas available for other uses (Amedi et al., 2005). If a\nblind person uses one finger to read Braille, the brain area dedicated to that finger\nexpands as the sense of touch invades the visual cortex that normally helps people\nsee (Barinaga, 1992a; Sadato et al., 1996). Temporarily “knock out” the visual cor-\ntex with magnetic stimulation, and a lifelong - blind person will make more errors on\na language task (Amedi et al., 2004). Similarly, in people whose native language is\nsigned, not spoken, the area of the temporal lobe normally dedicated to hearing\nwaits in vain for stimulation. Finally, it looks for other signals to process, such as\nthose from the visual system. That helps explain the finding that many deaf people\nhave enhanced peripheral vision (Bosworth & Dobkins, 1999).\nPlasticity is especially evident after serious damage. If a slow-growing tumor in\nthe left hemisphere disrupts language, the right hemisphere may compensate (Thiel\net al., 2006). Lose a finger and the sensory cortex that received its input will begin\nto receive input from the adjacent fingers, which then become more sensitive (Fox,\n1984). Lost fingers also feature in another mysterious phenomenon. As Figure 4.13\nshows, the hand is between the sensory cortex’s face and arm regions. When\nstroking the arm of someone whose hand had been amputated, V. S. Ramachandran\nfound that the person felt the sensations not only on the area stroked but also on\nthe nonexistent (“phantom”) fingers. Sensory fibers that terminate on adjacent\nareas had invaded the brain area vacated by the hand. \nNote, too, that the toes region is adjacent to the genitals.

One Johns Hopkins\nmedical team reflected on the child hemi-\nspherectomies they had performed. Although\nuse of the opposite hand is compromised, they\nreported being “awed” by how well children\nretain their memory, personality, and humor\nafter removal of either brain hemisphere\n(Vining et al., 1997). The younger the child,\nthe greater the chance that the remaining\nhemisphere can take over the functions of the\none that was surgically removed (Choi, 2008).\n“It is the way systems interact and\nhave a dynamic interdependence that\nis—unless one has lost all sense of\nwonder—quite awe-inspiring.”\n—Simon Conway Morris, “The Boyle\nLecture,” 2005\nJoe McNally/Joe McNally Photography\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 58\nlower leg had been amputated? “I actually experience my orgasm in my foot. And\nthere it’s much bigger than it used to be because it’s no longer just confined to my\ngenitals” (Ramachandran & Blakeslee, 1998,  p. 36).\nAlthough brain modification often takes the form of reorganization, evidence\nsuggests that, contrary to long - held belief, adult mice and humans can also gener-\nate new brain cells (Jessberger et al., 2008). Monkey brains illustrate neurogene-\nsis by forming thousands of new neurons each day. These baby neurons originate\ndeep in the brain and may then migrate elsewhere and form connections with\nneighboring neurons (Gould, 2007). Master stem cells that can develop into any\ntype of brain cell have also been discovered in the human embryo. If mass -\n produced in a lab and injected into a damaged brain, might neural stem cells turn\nthemselves into replacements for lost brain cells? Might we someday be able to re-\nbuild damaged brains, much as we reseed damaged lawns? Might new drugs spur\nthe production of new nerve cells? Stay tuned. Today’s biotech companies are\nhard at work on such possibilities (Gage, 2003). In the meantime, we can all ben-\nefit from other natural promoters of neurogenesis, such as exercise, sleep, and\nnonstressful but stimulating environments (Iso et al., 2007; Pereira et al., 2007;\nStranahan et al., 2006).\nOur Divided Brain\n4-6: What do split brains reveal about the functions of our two brain hemispheres?\nFor more than a century, clinical evidence has shown that the brain’s two sides\nserve differing functions. This hemispheric specialization (or lateralization) is appar-\nent after brain damage. Accidents, strokes, and tumors in the left hemisphere can\nimpair reading, writing, speaking, arithmetic reasoning, and understanding. Similar\nlesions in the right hemisphere seldom have such dramatic  effects.\nBy 1960, many interpreted these differences as evidence that the left hemisphere\nis the “dominant” or “major” hemisphere, and its silent companion to the right is\nthe “subordinate” or “minor” hemisphere. Then researchers found that the “minor”\nright hemisphere was not so limited after all. The story of this discovery is a fasci-\nnating chapter in psychology’s  history.\nSplitting the Brain\nIn 1961, two Los Angeles neurosurgeons, Philip Vogel and Joseph Bogen, specu-\nlated that major epileptic seizures were caused by an amplification of abnormal\nbrain activity bouncing back and forth between the two cerebral hemispheres. If so,\nthey wondered, could they put an end to this biological tennis game by severing the\ncorpus callosum (see FIGURE 4.21), the wide band of axon fibers connecting the\ntwo hemispheres and carrying messages between them?\nTHE BRAIN\n|\nMODULE 4\n| 59\nCorpus callosum\nFIGURE 4.21 The corpus callosum This\nlarge band of neural fibers connects the two\nbrain hemispheres. To photograph the half\nbrain shown at left, a surgeon separated the\nhemispheres by cutting through the corpus\ncallosum and lower brain regions.

Rother \nCourtesy of Terence Williams, University of Iowa \nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 59\nVogel and Bogen knew that psychologists Roger Sperry, Ronald Myers, and\nMichael Gazzaniga had divided the brains of cats and monkeys in this manner, with\nno serious ill effects. So the surgeons operated. The result? The seizures were all but\neliminated. Moreover, the patients with these split brains were surprisingly nor-\nmal, their personality and intellect hardly affected. Waking from surgery, one even\njoked that he had a “splitting headache” (Gazzaniga, 1967). \nSperry and Gazzaniga’s studies of people with split brains provide a key to un-\nderstanding the two hemispheres’ complementary functions. The peculiar nature of\nour visual wiring (FIGURE 4.22) enabled the researchers to send information to a pa-\ntient’s left or right hemisphere. As the person stared at a spot, they flashed a stimu-\nlus to its right or left. They could do this with you, too, but in your intact brain, the\nhemisphere receiving the information would instantly pass the news to its partner\nacross the valley. Not so in patients who had undergone split - brain surgery. Their\ncorpus callosum—the phone cables responsible for transmitting messages from one\nhemisphere to the other—had been severed. This enabled the researchers to quiz\neach hemisphere separately.\nIn an early experiment, Gazzaniga (1967) asked these patients to stare at a dot as\nhe flashed HE·ART on a screen (FIGURE 4.23). Thus, HE appeared in their left visual\nfield (which transmits to the right hemisphere) and ART in the right field (which\ntransmits to the left hemisphere). When he then asked what they had seen, the pa-\ntients said they had seen ART. But when asked to point to the word, they were star-\ntled when their left hand (controlled by the right hemisphere) pointed to HE. Given\nan opportunity to express itself, each hemisphere reported what it had seen. The\nright hemisphere (controlling the left hand) intuitively knew what it could not ver-\nbally  report.\n60\n|\nMODULE 4\n|\nTHE BRAIN\nVisual area\nof left\nhemisphere\nLeft \nvisual field\nRight \nvisual field\nOptic\nnerves\nSpeech\nVisual area\nof right\nhemisphere\nCorpus \ncallosum\nOptic\nchiasm\nFIGURE 4.22 The information highway\nfrom eye to brain Information from the left\nhalf of your field of vision goes to your right\nhemisphere, and information from the right\nhalf of your visual field goes to your left\nhemisphere, which usually controls speech.\n(Note, however, that each eye receives senso-\nry information from both the right and left\nvisual fields.) Data received by either hemi-\nsphere are quickly transmitted to the other\nacross the corpus callosum. In a person with\na severed corpus callosum, this information\nsharing does not take place.\n“Point with your left hand\nto the word you saw.”\nor\n“Look at the dot.”\n“What word did you see?”\nTwo words separated by a dot\nare momentarily projected.\n(b)\n(c)\n(a)\nFIGURE 4.23 Testing the divided brain\nWhen an experimenter flashes the word HEART\nacross the visual field, a woman with a split\nbrain reports seeing the portion of the word\ntransmitted to her left hemisphere.

(From\nGazzaniga, 1983.)\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 60\nWhen a picture of a spoon was flashed to their right hemisphere, the patients\ncould not say what they had viewed. But when asked to identify what they had\nviewed by feeling an assortment of hidden objects with their left hand, they readily\nselected the spoon. If the experimenter said, “Right!” the patient might reply,\n“What? Right? How could I possibly pick out the right object when I don’t know\nwhat I saw?” It is, of course, the left hemisphere doing the talking here, bewildered\nby what the nonverbal right hemisphere knows.\nA few people who have had split - brain surgery have been for a time bothered by\nthe unruly independence of their left hand, which might unbutton a shirt while the\nright hand buttoned it, or put grocery store items back on the shelf after the right\nhand put them in the cart. It was\nas if each hemisphere was think-\ning “I’ve half a mind to wear my\ngreen (blue) shirt today.” In-\ndeed, said Sperry (1964), split -\n brain surgery leaves people “with\ntwo separate minds.” With a split\nbrain, both hemispheres can\ncomprehend and follow an in-\nstruction \nto \ncopy—simultane-\nously—different figures with the\nleft and right hands (Franz et al.,\n2000; see also \nFIGURE 4.24).\n(Reading these reports, I fanta-\nsize a person enjoying a solitary\ngame of “rock, paper, scissors”—\nleft versus right hand.)\nWhen the “two minds” are at\nodds, the left hemisphere does\nmental gymnastics to rational-\nize reactions it does not under-\nstand. If a patient follows an order sent to the right hemisphere (“Walk”), a\nstrange thing happens. Unaware of the order, the left hemisphere doesn’t know\nwhy the patient begins walking. Yet, when asked why, the patient doesn’t say “I\ndon’t know.”  Instead, the interpretive left hemisphere improvises—“I’m going\ninto the house to get a Coke.” Thus, Gazzaniga (1988), who considers these pa-\ntients “The most fascinating people on earth,” concluded that the conscious left\nhemisphere is an “interpreter” or press agent that instantly constructs theories to\nexplain our behavior. \nRight-Left Differences in the Intact Brain\nSo, what about the 99.99+ percent of us with undivided brains? Does each of our\nhemispheres also perform distinct functions? Several different types of studies indi-\ncate they do.\nWhen a person performs a perceptual task, for example, brain waves, bloodflow,\nand glucose consumption reveal increased activity in the right hemisphere. When\nthe person speaks or calculates, activity increases in the left hemisphere. \nA dramatic demonstration of hemispheric specialization happens before some\ntypes of brain surgery. To check the location of language centers, the surgeon in-\njects a sedative into the neck artery feeding blood to the left hemisphere. Before\nthe injection, the patient is lying down, arms in the air, chatting with the doctor.\nCan you predict what happens when the drug flows into the artery going to the\nleft hemisphere? Within seconds, the person’s right arm falls limp. The patient\nalso usually becomes speechless until the drug wears off. When the drug enters\nthe artery to the right hemisphere, the left arm falls limp, but the person can still\nspeak.\nTHE BRAIN\n|\nMODULE 4\n| 61\nFIGURE 4.24 Try this!

No. Green.\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 61\nWhich hemisphere would you suppose enables sign language among deaf peo-\nple? The right, because of its visual - spatial superiority? Or the left, because it typi-\ncally processes language? Studies reveal that, just as hearing people usually use the\nleft hemisphere to process speech, deaf people use the left hemisphere to process\nsign language (Corina et al., 1992; Hickok et al., 2001). A stroke in the left hemi-\nsphere will disrupt a deaf person’s signing, much as it would disrupt a hearing per-\nson’s speaking. The same brain area is similarly involved in both spoken and signed\nspeech production (Corina, 1998). To the brain, language is language, whether spo-\nken or  signed. \nAlthough the left hemisphere is adept at making quick, literal interpretations of\nlanguage, the right hemisphere excels in making inferences (Beeman & Chiarello,\n1998; Bowden & Beeman, 1998; Mason & Just, 2004). Primed with the flashed\nword foot, the left hemisphere will be especially quick to recognize the closely asso-\nciated word heel. But if primed with foot, cry, and glass, the right hemisphere will\nmore quickly recognize another word distantly related to all three (cut). And if given\nan insightlike problem—“What word goes with boot, summer, and ground?”—the\nright hemisphere more quickly than the left recognizes the solution (camp). As one\npatient explained after a right - hemisphere stroke, “I understand words, but I’m\nmissing the subtleties.” \nThe right hemisphere performs other tasks as well. It helps us modulate our\nspeech to make meaning clear, as when we ask, “What’s that in the road ahead?” in-\nstead of “What’s that in the road, a head?” (Heller, 1990). \nThe right hemisphere also helps orchestrate our sense of self. People who suffer\npartial paralysis will sometimes obstinately deny their impairment—strangely\nclaiming they can move a paralyzed limb—if the damage is to the right hemisphere\n(Berti et al., 2005). With right-brain damage, some patients have difficulty perceiv-\ning who other people are in relation to themselves, as in the case of a man who saw\nmedical caretakers as family (Feinberg & Keenan, 2005). Others fail to recognize\nthemselves in a mirror, or they assign ownership of a limb to someone else (“that’s\nmy husband’s arm”). The power of the right brain appeared in an experiment in\nwhich people with normal brains viewed a series of images that progressively mor-\nphed from the face of a co-worker into their own face. As people recognized them-\nselves, parts of their right brain displayed sudden activity. But when magnetic\nstimulation disrupted their normal right-brain activity, they had difficulty recogniz-\ning themselves in the morphed photos (Uddin et al., 2005, 2006).\nSimply looking at the two hemispheres, so alike to the naked eye, who would\nsuppose they contribute uniquely to the harmony of the whole? Yet a variety of ob-\nservations—of people with split brains and people with normal brains—converge\nbeautifully, leaving little doubt that we have unified brains with specialized parts.\nThe mind seeking to understand the brain—that is indeed among the ultimate\nscientific challenges. And so it will always be. To paraphrase cosmologist John Bar-\nrow, a brain simple enough to be understood is too simple to produce a mind able\nto understand it.\n62\n|\nMODULE 4\n|\nTHE BRAIN\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 62\n63\nREVIEWING\n\n4-1: What are the functions of important lower-level brain\nstructures? The brainstem, the oldest part of the brain, is responsi-\nble for automatic survival functions. Its components are the medul-\nla (which controls heartbeat and breathing), the pons (which helps\ncoordinate movements), and the reticular formation (which affects\narousal). The thalamus, the brain’s sensory switchboard, sits above\nthe brainstem. The cerebellum, attached to the rear of the brainstem,\nenables some types of nonverbal learning and memory; coordinates\nmuscle movement; and helps process sensory information.\nThe limbic system’s neural centers include the hippocampus\n(which processes memories of facts and episodes), the amygdala\n(involved in emotions such as aggression and fear), and the hypo-\nthalamus (involved in various drives, maintenance functions, and\npleasurable rewards). The hypothalamus also controls the pituitary,\nwhich influences other glands to release hormones. \n4-2: How do neuroscientists study the brain’s connections to\nbehavior and mind? Clinical observations and lesioning have\nrevealed the general effects of brain damage. MRI scans now reveal\nbrain structures, and EEG, PET, and fMRI (functional MRI)\nrecordings reveal brain activity. \n4-3: How is the cerebral cortex organized? The cerebral cortex is\nthe thin layer of interconnected neurons covering the brain’s hemi-\nspheres. Prominent folds divide each hemisphere into four lobes—\nthe frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal.\nModule Review\n1. The brainstem is the oldest and inner-\nmost region of the brain.

Some brain\nregions serve specific functions. The motor cortex (at the rear of the\nfrontal lobes) controls muscle movement. The sensory cortex (at the\nfront of the parietal lobes) receives information from our senses.\nMost of the cortex is devoted to uncommitted association areas,\nwhich integrate information involved in learning, remembering,\nthinking, and other higher-level functions. Language depends on a\nchain of events in several brain regions, particularly Broca’s area,\nWernicke’s area, and the angular gyrus. Damage to any of these\nregions may cause one of several types of aphasia.\n4-5: To what extent can a damaged brain reorganize itself? If\none hemisphere is damaged early in life, the other will pick up\nmany of its functions. This plasticity diminishes later in life. Some\nbrain areas are capable of neurogenesis (forming new neurons).\n4-6: What do split brains reveal about the functions of our two\nbrain hemispheres? Split-brain research (experiments on people\nwith a severed corpus callosum) has confirmed that in most people,\nthe left hemisphere is the more verbal, and that the right hemi-\nsphere excels in visual perception and making inferences. Studies of\nhealthy people with intact brains confirm that each hemisphere\nmakes unique contributions to the integrated functioning of the\nbrain.\nRehearse It!\nThe Brain\nMyEx8eMod_04_MyersEx8e Modules  3/10/10  11:21 AM  Page 63\n64\n|\nMODULE 4\n|\nTHE BRAIN\nbrainstem, p. 47\nmedulla [muh-DUL-uh], p. 47\nlesion [LEE-zhuhn], p. 48\nelectroencephalogram (EEG), p. 48\nPET (positron emission tomography)\nscan, p. 48\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging), p. 48\nfMRI (functional magnetic resonance\nimaging), p. 48\nthalamus [THAL-uh-muss], p. 49\nreticular formation, p. 49\ncerebellum [sehr - uh - BELL-um], p. 49\nlimbic system, p. 50\namygdala [uh - MIG-duh - la], p. 50\nhypothalamus [hi - po - THAL-uh - muss], \np. 51\ncerebral [seh - REE-bruhl] cortex, p. 52\nfrontal lobes, p. 53 \nparietal [puh - RYE-uh - tuhl] lobes, p. 53\noccipital [ahk - SIP-uh - tuhl] lobes, p. 53\ntemporal lobes, p. 53\nmotor cortex, p. 54\nsensory cortex, p. 54\nassociation areas, p. 55\naphasia, p. 56\nBroca’s area, p. 56\nWernicke’s area, p. 56\nplasticity, p. 58\nneurogenesis, p. 59\ncorpus callosum [KOR-pus kah - LOW-\nsum], p. 59\nsplit brain, p. 60\nTerms and Concepts to Remember\nTest For Success: Critical Thinking Exercises\nBy Amy Himsel, El Camino College\n1.

The compiler verifies\nthat ExactQuantity  is assignable to Quantity . This is an example of:\nA)\nDynamic typing - the type is checked when the program runs\nB)\nStatic typing - the type is checked at compile time before the program runs\nC)\nDuck typing - any object with similar methods would work\nD)\nNo type checking occurs\nQuestion 3\nIn CookYourBooks, ExactQuantity , FractionalQuantity , and RangeQuantity  all extend\nQuantity . According to the Liskov Substitution Principle:\nA)\nEach subclass can implement toDecimal()  to return any value it wants\nB)\nEach subclass must be usable anywhere a Quantity  is expected without breaking the\nprogram\nC)\nSubclasses must have identical implementations of all methods\nD)\nOnly ExactQuantity  can be used where Quantity  is expected\nPage 3 / 10\nVERSION: Practice\nQuestion 4\nWhy is Quantity  declared as an abstract class  rather than a regular class?\nA)\nAbstract classes use less memory\nB)\nIt has abstract methods like toDecimal()  that subclasses must implement, and it should\nnot be instantiated directly\nC)\nJava requires all parent classes to be abstract\nD)\nIt makes the class immutable\nQuestion 5\nWhat distinguishes checked exceptions (e.g., IOException ) from unchecked exceptions (e.g.,\nIllegalArgumentException )?\nA)\nChecked exceptions are faster to throw\nB)\nChecked exceptions must be declared in the method signature or caught; unchecked\nexceptions do not\nC)\nUnchecked exceptions cannot be caught\nD)\nChecked exceptions extend RuntimeException\nQuestion 6\nIf CookYourBooks stored ingredients in a List  without generics, what problem (if any) would\noccur in compiling or running the following code?\nList ingredients = new ArrayList();\ningredients.add(new MeasuredIngredient(\"flour\", ...));\ningredients.add(\"A pinch of salt\");\nA)\nNothing; this is a fine practice\nB)\nWithout generics, the compiler can't prevent adding wrong types, leading to potential\nClassCastException  at runtime\nC)\nThe program runs slower\nD)\nArrayList  doesn't work without generics\nPage 4 / 10\nVERSION: Practice\nQuestion 7\nIn MeasuredIngredient.hashCode() , the name is converted to lowercase before hashing:\ngetName().toLowerCase() . Why?\nA)\nLowercase strings hash faster\nB)\nSince equals()  compares names case-insensitively, hashCode()  must also be case-\ninsensitive so equal objects have equal hash codes\nC)\nJava requires lowercase in hashCode()\nD)\nIt's just a style preference\nQuestion 8\nWhich of the following is NOT one of the three criteria for evaluating a good specification?\nA)\nRestrictiveness (rules out bad implementations)\nB)\nGenerality (doesn't over-constrain the implementation)\nC)\nEfficiency (specifies performance requirements)\nD)\nClarity (easy to understand)\nPage 5 / 10\nVERSION: Practice\nQuestion 9\nWhich specification for a reverse(String s)  method is more general? Spec A:\n/**\n * Creates a char[] from the string `s`, iterates from the last character to the first,\n * copying each to the array, then returns a new string from the array.\n * @param s a non-null string\n */\nSpec B:\n/**\n * Returns a new string with the characters of s in reverse order.\n * @param s a non-null string\n */\nA)\nSpec A, because it's more detailed\nB)\nSpec B, because it defines the result without mandating a specific algorithm\nC)\nThey are equally general\nD)\nSpec B, because it handles edge cases that Spec A doesn't\nQuestion 10\nMeasuredIngredient  overrides both equals()  and hashCode() . Why is it important to override\nboth together?\nA)\nThe compiler enforces that both must be overridden together\nB)\nEqual objects must have equal hash codes for hash-based collections to work correctly\nC)\nhashCode()  must call equals()  internally to compute its value\nD)\nOverriding only equals()  causes a compilation error in classes that use generics\nPage 6 / 10\nVERSION: Practice\nQuestion 11\nWhat should x.compareTo(y)  return if x  is less than y ?\nA)\ntrue\nB)\nfalse\nC)\nA negative integer\nD)\nZero\nQuestion 12\nWhat is the primary advantage of using a lambda expression instead of an anonymous class for a\nfunctional interface?\nA)\nLambdas are faster at runtime\nB)\nLambdas are more concise and reduce boilerplate code\nC)\nLambdas can implement multiple methods\nD)\nLambdas can access private fields that anonymous classes cannot\nQuestion 13\nWhat does the following method reference represent?\nlights.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(DimmableLight::getBrightness));\nA)\nA call to getBrightness()  on the DimmableLight  class itself\nB)\nA reference to the getBrightness  method that will be called on each DimmableLight\ninstance\nC)\nA static method that returns brightness values\nD)\nA constructor reference for creating DimmableLight  objects\nPage 7 / 10\nVERSION: Practice\nQuestion 14\nWhich of the following is NOT automatically provided by a Java record?\nA)\nA constructor that initializes all fields\nB)\nequals() , hashCode() , and toString()  implementations\nC)\nMutable setter methods for each field\nD)\nAccessor methods for each field\nQuestion 15\nConsider this method signature for code that compiles and runs correctly:\nvoid notifyStudent(Submission submission) {\n    sendEmail(submission.student.email, \"Your submission was received\");\n}\nThe method only uses submission.student.email . What is the main problem with this design?\nA)\nThe method cannot be tested without constructing a full Submission  object with a\nStudent\nB)\nThe method is slower than passing a String  directly\nC)\nThe method violates the Liskov Substitution Principle\nD)\nThe method cannot handle multiple submissions\nQuestion 16\nA Utility  class contains unrelated methods like formatDate() , calculateTax() , and\nvalidateEmail() . What is the main problem with this design?\nA)\nThe class will run out of memory\nB)\nThe class becomes a dumping ground that's hard to navigate, and changes to one method\nrisk affecting unrelated functionality\nC)\nJava does not allow static utility methods\nD)\nThe methods cannot be tested individually\nPage 8 / 10\nVERSION: Practice\nQuestion 17\nWhich SOLID principle states that \"a class should have only one reason to change\"?\nA)\nOpen/Closed Principle\nB)\nSingle Responsibility Principle\nC)\nInterface Segregation Principle\nD)\nDependency Inversion Principle\nQuestion 18\nConsider Java's I/O stream design:\nInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"data.txt\"));\nBufferedInputStream  wraps FileInputStream , adding buffering without modifying\nFileInputStream .
